In view of this, our external creditors must be required to write off Ukraine's debts. To date, the external debt is 1.6 trillion hryvnia, or more than $57 billion. International financial organizations should revise the debt policy and zero out the debts of Ukraine!\u201d the head of the Accounts Chamber of Ukraine, Valeriy Patskan, wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine last Thursday. President Vladimir Putin said its goal is \u201cthe protection of people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years,\u201d referring to the shelling of the two Donbass republics, which broke away from Ukraine in 2014. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense has been repeatedly stating that its armed forces target only the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops, not the civilian population. However, many Western states see the military operation as an \u201cunprovoked\u201d aggression against Ukraine, hitting Moscow with sanctions.

        "content": "Wargaming still has imagery like this on its website (pic: Wargaming) The creative director of World Of Tanks has left publisher Wargaming, who have made a \u00a3745,000 donation to the Ukrainian Red Cross. Although there are a number of Ukrainian video game developers, including STALKER 2 maker GSC Game World, Russia, despite its size, has very few that are known internationally. World Of Tanks maker Wargaming is often thought to be an exception but they\u2019re actually from Belarus and headquartered in Cyprus. Wargaming has remained sensibly quiet since the invasion of Ukraine and has reacted quickly to a Facebook post from now former creative director Sergey Burkatovskiy, who wrote in support of the Russian army and separatist groups in the east of Ukraine. The message was seen as especially abhorrent because Wargaming employs hundreds of developers in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which is currently under increasingly barbarous attack by Russian forces. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live In a statement to Cyber.Sports.ru, Wargaming said, as translated by PC Gamer, that the comments were Burkatovskiy\u2019s \u2018personal opinion, which categorically does not coincide with the position of the company\u2019. A day later Burkatovskiy posted on Facebook that he had \u2018broke up with the VG [possibly WG, depending on the translation], with Wargaming later confirming to PC Gamer that he had in fact left the company. When the invasion first began Wargaming cancelled all advertising worldwide and while it has now restarted it everywhere outside of Ukraine, it now features no images of advancing tanks or military vehicles.

Gisdol replaced Serbian manager Marko Nikolic, who was viewed as a much more popular figure among the Lokomotiv fanbase. The German leaves Lokomotiv languishing in seventh position in the Russian Premier League table as the competition resumes following the winter break. Lokomotiv ended third last season under Nikolic. \u00a0\u00a0 Lokomotiv announced that Lokomotiv would work under German coach Marvin Compper as they prepare for their upcoming games, starting with a Russian Cup tie against Yenisey in Moscow on Thursday. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0441 \u0413\u0438\u0441\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0451\u043d \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0424\u041a \u00ab\u041b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u00bb.\u041a \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0430\u0439\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043f\u0435\u0440. \u041a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u041a\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0420\u041f\u041b pic.twitter.com/UmcqSCgLbd\u2014 \u00ab\u041b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u00bb (@fclokomotiv) March 1, 2022 Lokomotiv\u2019s planned Premier League return against Krasnodar in the south of Russia last weekend was postponed due to temporary restrictions at airports in the region because of the Ukraine conflict.

        "content": "The Canadian foreign affairs minister is the latest western politician to head to Poland \u2014 where thousands of Ukrainians fleeing violence are pouring across the border \u2014 as Canada sends more military aid to Ukraine. M\u00e9lanie Joly will be joining 50 Canadian airlift personnel at the Poland-Ukraine border on Tuesday. She will help ensure Canada\u2019s latest supply of aid flows into the war-ravaged nation and will get an update from Polish counterparts on the refugee crisis at the border. Canada is delivering $25 million worth of non-lethal military aid, including helmets, body armor, gas masks, and night-vision gear. A military plane is transporting the latest shipment of equipment to the country. Speaking at the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, Joly said that Russia lied to the world ahead of its invasion. \u201cThey are trying to justify their war by spreading false rhetoric and attempting to manipulate the principles of human rights and to support their illegal and illegitimate violence,\u201d she said. Human rights are universal and can\u2019t be manipulated to justify war and crime. In addressing the UNHCR, I called on the international community to recognize the human rights violations of Russia in Ukraine, and to call an end to this madness. pic.twitter.com/65JY0VBT1d \u2014 M\u00e9lanie Joly (@melaniejoly) February 28, 2022 Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are attempting to get into Poland and the United Nations refugee agency says more than half a million people have fled from Ukraine to other nations since the invasion began last week. Canada has approved nearly 4,000 Ukrainians for immigration to Canada and Immigration Minister Sean Fraser says the federal government is working to ensure Ukrainians who are already in Canada on a temporary basis will not see their visas run out. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to extend temporary status and issue open work permits to Ukrainian visitors, workers, and students who are already in Canada,\u201d said Fraser on Monday. \u201cWe expected upon reports of a potential further invasion into Ukraine that we would see the displacement of Ukrainians. That\u2019s why we started preparing more than a month ago to ensure we had the ability to respond to a potential influx of people seeking to come to Canada.\u201d On Tuesday, the UN is expected to plead for humanitarian support for Ukrainians displaced by the violence in their country and those who are still within the country\u2019s borders. Joly\u2019s visit to oversee the delivery of the non-lethal aid follows Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s announcement on Monday that Canada was sending anti-tank weapons and upgraded ammunition to Ukraine, which amounted to a significant enhancement in lethal military aid. Canada will be providing 125 portable anti-tank weapons and two thousand rockets from the arsenal of the Canadian Forces. The federal government banned Canadian financial institutions from any transactions with the Russian Central Bank on Monday. In addition, Canada imposed an asset freeze and a dealings prohibition on Russian sovereign wealth funds. Canada had already placed sanctions on Russian elites and politicians, including Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, as well as individual banks. With files from The Canadian Press",

        "content": "A Soviet TOS-1A heavy flamethrower unit taking part in a live firing exercise at Russia\u2019s Tarskoye firing range. (Credits: Getty) As Russia continues its horrific actions in Ukraine, Putin stands accused of using a devastating weapon known as a thermobaric bomb. These devastating weapons are capable of vaporising human bodies and reducing buildings to rubble. They work by sucking in oxygen from the surrounding air to create a more powerful high-temperature explosion. As well as an increased blast, a so-called \u2018vacuum bomb\u2019 produces a large pressure wave. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Because of their destructive power, they are rarely used. But it\u2019s been alleged that Putin has used them against Ukraine. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with White House lawmakers on Monday that they have been deployed during the ongoing incursion. She said: \u2018They used the vacuum bomb today. The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.\u2019 How does a vacuum bomb work? A thermobaric bomb explosion during the Caucasus 2016 strategic drills at Opuk range of Russia\u2019s Southern Military District. (Credits: TASS) Both the United States and the Soviet Union developed thermobaric bombs in the 1960s. A regular explosive uses a process called oxidation in a confined region to create an explosion. The weapon mixes the explosive fuel with an oxidizer to create the blast. However, a thermobaric bomb consists of almost 100% fuel. It uses the oxygen in the surrounding air as an oxident that results in a far larger explosion. However, because it relies on the air around it \u2013 the kind of yield from a vacuum bomb can vary. The explosion will depend on how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel.

But they can be exceptionally deadly in urban or battlefield warfare. They can also be fitted to both vehicular and hand-held rocket launchers. Are thermobaric bombs illegal? Firefighters try to extinguish a fire from a bombed civilian building in a residential area in Kyiv. (Credits: Getty) Although not specifically illegal, the use of vacuum bombs and cluster munitions (which release smaller amounts of schrapnel over a wider area) is widely condemned. Amnesty International say international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons \u2013 such as cluster munitions. The organisation saus launching any indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime. More than 100 countries have committed never to use the weapons under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, including the UK \u2013 but neither Russia nor Ukraine have signed the agreement. Russian forces appear to be using cluster bombs to destroy entire residential blocks in Kharkiv. This is a fall-back tactic Russia have a habit of using to instil fear into the population.

That sound is terrifying even from a distance.#Ukraine pic.twitter.com/9SpTyeweM1\u2014 KT CounterIntelligence (@KremlinTrolls) February 28, 2022 Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said: \u2018It is stomach-turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe haven. Is Russia using thermobaric bombs against Ukraine? Russian TOS-1 rocket launchers (L) have been accused of using vacuum bombs in Ukraine (Credits: Getty) Reports claim TOS-1 rocket launchers capable of firing thermobaric weapons have been spotted among Russian troops. One Western official said their presence is a cause for \u2018considerable concern\u2019, the Independent reports. The official added: \u2018Certainly, if it is used in any built-up area, there is no way you can eradicate the risk of significant civilian casualties.\u2019 There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine and Ms Markarova did not reveal where the bomb she referred to was used.

He said: \u2018A vacuum bomb has been dropped on an oil storage depot, containers with oil have been torn off.

        "description": "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, says Ukraine fell victim to US policy, which led to the current escalation Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "Ayatollah Khamenei said foreign powers\u2019 influence brought Ukraine to a tragic tipping point The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, claims that Ukraine fell victim to American policies aimed at creating crises around the globe. Khamenei cited Washington\u2019s influence as the \u201croot cause\u201d of the current military conflict in Ukraine. In a series of statements published on Tuesday both by Iranian media and on the supreme leader\u2019s Twitter page, Khamenei said the \u201cUS dragged Ukraine to where it is now.\u201d Among Washington\u2019s actions that he thinks led to the military confrontation with Russia were America\u2019s alleged interference in the Eastern European nation\u2019s \u201cinternal affairs\u201d in the form of \u201ccreating color revolutions and toppling one government and putting another in power.\u201d Khamenei noted that Iran \u201csupports ending the war in Ukraine.\u201d Read more China comments on Western sanctions against Russia Iran\u2019s supreme leader also said the latest dramatic events in Ukraine should serve as an important lesson to other countries. One of the two key conclusions that can be drawn according to Khamenei is that America and Europe\u2019s support for other countries is just a \u201cmirage and not real.\u201d The cleric went on to liken \u201ctoday\u2019s Ukraine\u201d to \u201cyesterday\u2019s Afghanistan,\u201d in that both nations were \u201cleft alone\u201d by the US and Western governments. The other important lesson which Khamenei said could be learned from the Ukrainian crisis is that the \u201cpeople are governments\u2019 most important support.\u201d He proceeded to claim that the \u201cpeople of Ukraine\u201d did not really \u201capprove of the government.\u201d According to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, had the Ukrainian government enjoyed popular support, it would not have found itself in the current situation. For years now, Iran has been languishing under sweeping sanctions imposed by the US and its Western allies, mostly over its nuclear program. Russia has now also been targeted with a raft of unprecedented sanctions by the US, EU, Canada, and several allies in Asia. The punitive measures came in response to Russia launching a military offensive in Ukraine on February 24, which, according to President Vladimir Putin, is not an attempt to occupy the country, but rather to \u201cdemilitarize and denazify\u201d it. Ukraine and its allies, however, see these claims as a mere pretext for an \u201cunprovoked\u201d invasion.",

        "description": "The student, who was pursuing medicine, hailed from Karnataka. At noon today, the Indian Embassy issued an urgent advisory, asking students to leave Kyiv immediately, by any means available",
        "content": "An Indian student has been killed in the ongoing shelling in Ukraine's city Kharkiv, said the Ministry of External Affairs on Twitter. The news was shared by the MEA's official spokesperson Arindam Bagchi who said that the student passed away this morning, on March 1, and that the Ministry is in touch with his family.\u00a0 The student, identified as aveen Shekharappa Gyanagoudar, was a native of Karnataka and had been pursuing medicine at the Kharkiv National Medical University. Naveen was 20 years old and was in his fourth year at the Medical University. He had left his shelter to get some food and was killed waiting in line at a grocery store, caught in Russian firing, said a report in the Indian Express.\u00a0\u00a0 The Ministry has also said that the Foreign Secretary of India is in contact with the ambassadors of Russia and Ukraine to ensure the safe passage of Indian students out of the war-torn country. \"Similar action is also being undertaken by our ambassadors in Russia and Ukraine,\" the MEA said. At around noon today, the Indian Embassy in Ukraine had sent out an urgent advisory to all citizens and students to evacuate from the capital city of Kyiv as early as possible. \"Preferably by trains or through any other means available,\" said the Embassy on Twitter. In reply to the advisory, a few Indian students had tweeted that they had been waiting at the railway station since yesterday, and the Ukrainian authorities had not allowed them to board the train.\u00a0 A video also emerged yesterday of Indian students allegedly being harassed and manhandled by Ukrainian security personnel on the Polish border. Poland had said that they would allow Indian students to pass into the country without any visa hassles. However, Indian students stranded at the border said that both the Ukrainian and the Polish Embassies were unclear about the process. They also claimed that Indian students had been facing harassment from Ukrainian authorities after India's decision to abstain from voting at the UN to condemn Russia's invasion of the country upset them.\u00a0 There were about 20,000 Indian citizens in Ukraine, 18,000 of whom were reportedly students. The ministry says that they have, so far, evacuated 8000 citizens from the country, including 1,369 via Operation Ganga. With several MPs receiving anxious calls from families of Indian nationals stuck in war-hit Ukraine, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has asked parliamentarians to directly contact his office to flag \"particular concerns\" and share information about such people. The government had on Monday decided to send four ministers to several neighbouring countries of Ukraine to coordinate the evacuation exercise.",

Russia invaded the neighboring country last week, arguing that it was defending the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which broke off from Ukraine following the 2014 coup in Kiev. Ukraine said that the attack was entirely unprovoked and rallied the international community for help. Two soldiers from Chechnya were killed and six were wounded, Ramzan Kadyrov wrote on social media on Tuesday, without elaborating.

        "content": "Russian shelling pounded civilian targets in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city again Tuesday and a 40-mile convoy of tanks and other vehicles threatened the capital \u2014 tactics Ukraine\u2019s embattled president said were designed to force him into concessions in Europe\u2019s largest ground war in generations. With the Kremlin increasingly isolated by tough economic sanctions that have tanked the ruble currency, Russian troops attempted to advance on Ukraine\u2019s two biggest cities. In strategic Kharkiv, an eastern city with a population of about 1.5 million, videos posted online showed explosions hitting the region\u2019s Soviet-era administrative building and residential areas. Throughout the country, many Ukrainian civilians spent another night huddled in shelters, basements or corridors. The casualty toll mounted as Ukraine faced Day 6 of a Russian invasion that has shaken the 21st century world order. Hopes for a negotiated solution to the war dimmed after a first, five-hour session of talks between Ukraine and Russia yielded no stop in the fighting, though both sides agreed to another meeting in coming days.

He did not offer details of the talks between Ukrainian and Russian envoys, but he said Kyiv was not prepared to make concessions \u201cwhen one side is hitting another with rocket artillery.\u201d As the talks along the Belarusian border wrapped up, several blasts could be heard in the capital, and Russian troops advanced on the city of nearly 3 million. The convoy of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was 25 kilometers (17 miles) from the center of the city and stretched about 65 kilometers (40 miles), according to satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies. \u201cThey want to break our nationhood, that\u2019s why the capital is constantly under threat,\u201d Zelenskyy said, saying that it was hit by three missile strikes on Monday and that hundreds of saboteurs were roaming the city. Kharkiv, near the Russian border, is another key target. One after the other, explosions burst through a residential area of the city in one video verified by AP. In the background, a man pleaded with a woman to leave, and a woman cried. Determined for life to go on despite the shelling, hospital workers transferred a Kharkiv maternity ward to a bomb shelter. Amid makeshift electrical sockets and mattresses piled up against the walls, pregnant women paced the crowded space, accompanied by the cries of dozens of newborns. The Russian military has denied targeting residential areas despite abundant evidence documented by AP reporters around Ukraine of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals. Regional administration chief Oleh Sinehubov said that the administration headquarters in the city center also came under Russian shelling. Images posted online showed the building\u2019s facade and interior badly damaged by a powerful explosion that also blew up part of its roof. The state emergencies agency said that attack wounded six people, including a child. Sinehubov said that at least 11 people were killed and scores of others were wounded during Monday\u2019s shelling of the city. Meanwhile, flames shot up from a military base northeast of Kyiv, in the suburb of Brovary, in footage shot from a car driving past. In another video verified by AP, a passenger pleads with the driver, \u201cMisha, we need to drive quickly as they\u2019ll strike again.\u201d And Ukrainian authorities released details and photos of an attack Sunday on a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, saying more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed along with some local residents. The attack could not be immediately confirmed. The Russian military\u2019s movements have been stalled by fierce resistance on the ground and a surprising inability to dominate Ukraine\u2019s airspace. In the face of that resistance, the Kremlin has twice in as many days raised the specter of nuclear war and put on high alert an arsenal that includes intercontinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers. Stepping up his rhetoric, President Vladimir Putin denounced the United States and its allies as an \u201cempire of lies.\u201d Western nations have increased weapons shipments to Ukraine to help its forces defend themselves \u2014 but have so far ruled out sending in troops. Still, the embattled country moved to solidify its ties to the West by applying to join the European Union \u2014 a largely symbolic move for now, but one that won\u2019t sit well with Putin, who was already infuriated by Ukraine\u2019s desire to join the NATO alliance. Messages aimed at the advancing Russian soldiers popped up on billboards, bus stops and electronic traffic signs across the capital. Some used profanity to encourage Russians to leave. Others appealed to their humanity. \u201cRussian soldier \u2014 Stop! Remember your family. Go home with a clean conscience,\u201d one read. Fighting raged in other towns and cities. The strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, is \u201changing on,\u201d said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. An oil depot was reported bombed in the eastern city of Sumy. In the seaside resort town of Berdyansk, dozens of protesters chanted angrily in the main square against Russian occupiers, yelling at them to go home and singing the Ukrainian national anthem. They described the soldiers as exhausted young conscripts. \u201cFrightened kids, frightened looks. They want to eat,\u201d Konstantin Maloletka, who runs a small shop, said by telephone. He said the soldiers went into a supermarket and grabbed canned meat, vodka and cigarettes. \u201cThey ate right in the store,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looked like they haven\u2019t been fed in recent days.\u201d For many, Russia\u2019s announcement of a nuclear high alert stirred fears that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia\u2019s nuclear posture. As far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia\u2019s Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency. But that did little to calm Russian fears. In Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as the sanctions threatened to drive up prices and reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians. The economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia\u2019s growing status as a pariah country. Russian airliners are banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country. On Monday, international sports bodies moved to exclude Russian athletes and officials from international events, including soccer\u2019s World Cup. The U.N. human rights chief said Monday at least 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded \u2014 warning that figure is probably a vast undercount. More than a half-million people have fled the country since the invasion, another U.N. official said, many of them going to Poland, Romania and Hungary. Among the refugees in Hungary was Maria Pavlushko, 24, an information technology project manager from a city west of Kyiv. She said her father stayed behind to fight the Russians. \u201cI am proud about him,\u201d she said, adding that many of her friends were planning to fight, too.",

Matty Cash, the Aston Villa defender, was booked after revealing a message for Poland team-mate Tomasz Kedziora following his goal against Brighton on Saturday. Kedziora signed for Dynamo Kiev five years ago and he\u2019s remained in the Ukrainian capital since the attacks started. His country \u2013 Poland \u2013 are also refusing to play Russia in a World Cup play-off later this month.

CCTV video posted on social media shows a missile-shaped projectile causing a massive explosion. Ukrainian emergency services said it was an airstrike carried out by Russian forces, and urged locals to seek shelter. RT was unable to independently verify this claim. Emergency services said six people were injured, including a child. The incident occurred after reports of intense shelling in the city on Monday. Kharkov is located roughly 40km (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Ukraine previously reported combat with Russian troops advancing on the city. \u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0430 pic.twitter.com/5fcoU87vvw\u2014 M:ara (@gt_lotrz) March 1, 2022 Moscow has not commented on the strike as of yet. Russia previously insisted that it was only hitting military targets, such as airfields and radar stations. Russia attacked the neighboring state last week, arguing that it was defending the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which broke off from Ukraine following the 2014 coup in Kiev. Ukraine said the attack was entirely unprovoked and called on the international community for help. Many countries, including the US, UK, and EU member states, imposed new sanctions on Russia, hitting its banks and trade, among other things. The majority of European countries closed their airspace to Russian airlines, and Moscow responded in kind. Russians and Ukrainians held the first round of peace talks in Belarus on Monday.",

A huge explosion can be seen outside the regional headquarter of Kharkiv, a mostly Russian speaking city in northeastern Ukraine. Kharkiv region head Oleg Synegubov accused Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime of war crimes after launching missiles at the city and said its defences were holding up. He shared a video of an explosion at the regional administration building, which showed passing cars just about making it through the blast. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live It appears the building was not directly hit, with some speculating the attack was aimed at a Ukrainian army recruitment centre outside. Residential areas were also reportedly hit by missiles, with six people injured so far, including a child.

He said \u2018Putin is unable to break Ukraine down\u2019 and added: \u2018He commits more war crimes out of fury, murders innocent civilians.\u2019 Many journalists were quick to point out that attacks like this did not look like a \u2018liberation\u2019 of a Russian-speaking city as Putin would like to portray. It comes after Russia was accused of using vacuum bombs and cluster munitions during its invasion of Ukraine. Also known as thermobaric weapons, vacuum bombs suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to create a more powerful high-temperature explosion capable of vaporising human bodies.

The mission will likely be put on pause due to anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the EU in retaliation for attacking Ukraine. \u201cThe sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely\u201d for the Rosalind Franklin rover, the statement said. ESA\u2019s Director General will \u201canalyze all the options and prepare a formal decision on the way forward by ESA Member States.\u201d The mission is part of the international ExoMars program and involves a Russian launch vehicle and lander and a European carrier and lander. Its primary objective is to look for evidence of life presence on Mars in the past, hence the rover was named after Franklin, a British chemist whose work was essential tp the discovery of DNA molecules. The Trace Gas Orbiter \u2013 launched in 2016 is supposed to relay data between the planet surface and Earth. Read more Russia\u2019s space agency responds to Western sanctions The rocket carrying the robotic explorer was originally scheduled to take off in July 2020, but the parties decided to perform additional tests of equipment, which necessitated a two-year delay until the next launch window. If the mission misses the September 2022 opportunity, it will have to be postponed by at least 26 more months. Last week Roscosmos announced it was suspending Soyuz rocket launches from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana. It was done in retaliation for European sanctions imposed against the Russian space industry, which barred it from importing Western technology. The ESA said it will \u201cassess for each European institutional payload under our responsibility the appropriate launch service\u201d. European launch systems, including the Ariane 6 and upcoming Vega-C are to substitute Russian rockets, it said.",

        "content": "Yaroslav Rakitsky may have played his last game for Zenit Saint Petersburg (Picture: Getty Images) Ukrainian defender Yaroslav Rakitsky may not play for Zenit St Petersburg again, with manager Sergei Semak admitting he does not know whether his time at the club is effectively at an end. 32-year-old Rakitsky, who has 54 caps for his country, has been at Zenit since making a controversial move from Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2019, a switch which was unpopular in Ukraine. He is into the final few months of his contract, which expires in June and Mail Online report that he has already been dropped to the substitutes\u2019 bench for speaking out against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Rakitsky posted a picture of a Ukraine flag on Instagram with the caption \u2018I\u2019m Ukrainian!\u2019 which was reportedly behind him being dropped for the Europa League clash with Real Betis last week. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Now Semak says he is not sure whether the defender will play for the club again and that will be, at least partly, down to Rakitsky himself. \u2018The atmosphere not only inside the club, but in the country is such that any person is worried and takes what is happening to heart,\u2019 said Semak after Zenit beat Rubin Kazan on Monday. \u2018Yaroslav asked for a couple of days off to resolve his personal issues. Tomorrow he should be in training. Sergei Semak could not be sure on Rakitskyy\u2019s immediate future (Picture: Getty Images) \u2018It\u2019s hard for me to say whether he will play Rakitsky for Zenit. His contract is valid for three months. \u2018Each person makes his own decisions. He asked for the weekend, what will happen next? I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Legend of Ukrainian football Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, who has 144 caps for the country, is a coach at Zenit and was absent from the win on Monday, but Semak insisted it was just down to illness. \u2018Tolya [Tymoshchuk] drove to the base during the day, but then he got a sore throat and we decided to save him,\u2019 he said.

The only club side that has hit is Spartak Moscow, who have been thrown out of the Europa League, with RB Leipzig getting a bye to the quarter-finals. A club statement read that they do not agree with the decision but have been \u2018forced to obey\u2019 it. The statement read: \u2018UEFA and FIFA have decided to exclude from the current iteration of the Europa League. This means that our round of 16 ties against RB Leipzig will not go ahead as planned. \u2018This verdict is connected to the organisations\u2019 position on recent events that have taken place in Ukraine. Spartak Moscow topped their Europa League group ahead of Leicester, Napoli and Legia Warsaw (Picture: Getty Images) \u2018The recent decision taken by UEFA and FIFA although expected, is extremely upsetting. Unfortunately, the efforts that our club made in the Europa League have been nullified for reasons that are far outside the remit of sports. \u2018Spartak has millions of fans not only in Russia, but all over the world. Our successes and failures bring people from dozens of different countries together. \u2018We believe that sport, even in the most difficult times, should aim to build bridges, and not burn them. We are forced to obey a decision that we do not agree with.\u2019 \u201cFor now, we shall focus on domestic competitions, and are looking forward to a speedy achievement of peace that everybody needs.

        "content": "Vacuum bombs can vaporise human bodies (Pictures: EPA/AFP/Getty) Vladimir Putin has been accused of war crimes after allegedly using devastating vacuum bombs and cluster munitions during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Also known as thermobaric weapons, vacuum bombs suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to create a more powerful high-temperature explosion capable of vaporising human bodies. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with White House lawmakers on Monday that they have been deployed during the ongoing incursion. She said: \u2018They used the vacuum bomb today. The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.\u2019 For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live What is a thermobaric weapon? Dubbed the \u2018father of all bombs\u2019, they draw in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. The so-called vacuum bombs are much deadlier than conventional weapons, capable of vaporising human bodies, crushing internal organs and reducing cities to rubble. The US dropped a thermobaric bombs on the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2017. It weighed 21,600 pounds and left a crater more than 300 metres wide after it exploded six feet above the ground. Western officials believe Russia could resort to using thermobaric weapons (Picture: Getty) In a study, the CIA states that vacuum bombs can \u2018obliterate\u2019 anybody \u2018near the ignition point\u2019. The US intelligence agency adds: \u2018Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.\u2019 Western officials have voiced concerns that Russia may resort to using them against Ukrainians if their fierce resistance continues to slow their advance. Reports claim TOS-1 rocket launchers capable of firing thermobaric weapons have been spotted among Russian troops. One Western official said their presence is a cause for \u2018considerable concern\u2019, the Independent reports. The official added: \u2018Certainly, if it is used in any built-up area, there is no way you can eradicate the risk of significant civilian casualties.\u2019 A school destroyed as a result of fight not far from the centre of Ukrainian city of Kharkiv (Picture: AFP via Getty) A man walks past a building damaged following a rocket attack, in Kyiv (Picture: AP) People walk past burned cars a day after a shelling on a residential area in Kiev (Picture: EPA) There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine and Ms Markarova did not reveal where the bomb she referred to was used. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she had also seen reports of them being unleashed, adding: \u2018If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.\u2019 Pavel Kuzmenko, the mayor of Akhtyrka, a small city northwest of Kharkhiv, claimed a vacuum bomb had been dropped on an oil depot there. He said: \u2018A vacuum bomb has been dropped on an oil storage depot, containers with oil have been torn off. The enemy vilely uses vacuum bombs banned by the Geneva Convention.\u2019 Russia has also been accused of using cluster bombs to \u2018indiscriminately\u2019 target innocent civilians. Amnesty International has condemned their reported use in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school \u2018may constitute a war crime\u2019. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T5M19S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/28\\/21\\/54772705-0-image-a-1_1646083196760.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-28T20:50:53+0000\",\"description\":\"A male teacher at the school, Alexsey, held up metal wreckage that he said was part of a rocket used in the attack.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/28\\/6658223251788050929\\/640x360_MP4_6658223251788050929.mp4\",\"height\":360,\"width\":640} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The human rights charity said \u2018a 220mm Uragan rocket dropped\u00a0cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast\u2019 on Friday.

More than 100 countries have committed never to use the weapons under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, including the UK \u2013 but neither Russia nor Ukraine have signed the agreement. Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said: \u2018It is stomach-turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe haven.

On Friday, it said a cluster bomb had been used the day before by the Russian military in the town of Vuhledar. Four civilians were killed in the attack, the organisation said.

        "content": "Several Indian students stuck in eastern parts of Ukraine, which is largely affected by the Russian military offensive, are facing a grim situation as it is difficult for them to travel by road to reach the western borders and move out of the war-hit country, one of the students returned to India said here on Tuesday. A number of students evacuated from Ukraine arrived in Mumbai by an Air India Express flight from the Romanian capital Bucharest on Tuesday morning. Talking to reporters at the Mumbai airport, one of the evacuees, Nishi Malkani said the university where she was studying is located in west Ukraine, where the situation is comparatively better. \"We hid in our hostels for a couple of days and then managed to reach the western border quickly. Thousands of students in educational institutions in the eastern parts of Ukraine are facing a grim situation as travelling by road from there is extremely difficult,\u0094 she said. \"There should be more efforts to provide an access to those students for safe return,\" she added. Asked about her experience in the last few days, Malkani said, \u0093I had never thought that I will face a situation like this in my life. We were asked by our university administration to remain inside our hostels for four days. We were close to Ukraine's western borders, so we could cross over to neighbouring Romania quickly. The Indian embassy officials helped further and we could return home,\u0094 she said. She also claimed there were \"some militants\" on her university campus in the last few days, but the students were not harmed. Poorva Patil, another student who came back from Ukraine on Tuesday, thanked God for the safe return. She was also pursuing an educational course at an institution in west Ukraine. \"I feared for my life, but by God's grace, I am back home. It is a big thing for me,\u0094 she said. Narrating her experience in the war-torn country, Patil said, \u0093First, we were asked to stay inside our hostel rooms and were later sheltered in bunkers. It was severe cold with temperature around 2 degrees Celsius. We travelled almost 10 km by hiring a bus to reach near the Romanian border.\u0094 She has been exhausted after facing such a difficult situation. \"My feet are swollen,\u0094 Patil said, adding that she received good support from the Indian embassy officials in facilitating her safe return. Some of the other evacuees also said that many Indian students were still stuck in Ukraine and were in need of support. Union Minister Narayan Rane, who received the students at the airport here, said, \u0093As many as 182 students have returned to Mumbai today. It was the fifth flight organised by the Union government under 'Operation Ganga'.\"",

        "description": "The largest International student group stranded in Ukraine amid the conflict is Indian students among which most are students pursuing MBBS in Ukraine.",
        "content": "As the Russian invasion in Ukraine enters its sixth day on Tuesday 1st March, more than 100 civilians are already killed including children and at least 14,000 Indians are still left stranded in the war-hit country of Ukraine.However, in the previous week, thousands of Indian nationals were brought back home to India from Ukraine through the initiative by the Indian embassy in Ukraine. Among those Indian nationals brought back to the country and those still stuck in Ukraine, most are medical students pursuing their courses in Ukraine. Throughout this conflict between the two European nations, it came to light that a huge number of students from different countries choose Ukraine to pursue their medical education. Around 80,000 international students study in Ukraine and a total of 18,095 are Indians as per the data provided by the Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine. 24% of overseas students in Ukraine were Indians in the year 2020. Here are the 11 reasons why Indian students choose Ukraine over India for medical studies: Quality Education: The country Ukraine is known across the globe for providing high-quality education and this attracts a lot of international students including Indians who look for quality education in their own country but fails to afford it.No entrance exam for Medical seats: One of the major reasons to study medicine in Ukraine is that no entrance exam is conducted by famous medical institutions to provide a seat to any students. In India, as the students struggle a lot to pass entrance exams and secure a seat in medical colleges by competing with a huge number of students so they choose Ukraine.Cheaper tuition fees: It is well-known to everyone how costly it is to pursue medical in Indian private medical institutions but in comparison Ukraine provides much cheaper private medical colleges which are affordable for every section of people.Global Recognition: The medical colleges in Ukraine and the degrees provided by them are recognized by worldwide medical councils including the World Health Council, Indian Medical Council, General Medical Council of UK, Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, and European Council of Medicine. The MBBs institution in Ukraine got approval from global bodies like UNESCO and WHO.Average Medical Infrastructure: Ukraine provides an average medical infrastructure with 33 medical colleges and standard infrastructure.Opportunity in India: Those students returning from Ukraine with medical degree gets a better opportunity in India as they sit for the Foreign Medical Graduates exam after clearing which they become eligible for a license to practice medicine.Scarcity of seats in India: India provides a very limited seat for medical candidates despite the huge number of students interested to pursue the course. The country has 84,000-odd MBBS seats and 1.61 million candidates had registered for NEET exams last year for these seats.English is the only mode of Instruction: Language is another important element that students give a thought to before going to take admission in any institution and in the case of medical courses it plays a very significant role. In all colleges of Ukraine, the only mode of instruction is English which is simple for students as they don't need to learn foreign languages that become mandatory in other foreign countries.Ukraine ranks 4th in Europe for having the largest number of graduate and post-graduates specializations in medicine.Low Living Cost: Along with the less expensive fee for admission in the MBBS institution in Ukraine students also have to pay a low cost for their living in the country which costs much in other foreign countries.Multicultural Environment: The medical students in Ukraine enjoy a multicultural environment as its institutions provide education to students from a variety of cultural backgrounds.Also read: Ukraine Creates 'IT Army' To Hack Russian WebsitesAlso watch:\u00a0",

        "content": "A US-based charitable non-profit organisation here has launched a helpline to help evacuate international students stranded in war-ravaged Ukraine by arranging for transportation to the nearest border check post and making arrangements for food and other essential supplies for their journey. Sewa International already has over 4,000 students registered in its helpline, with its volunteers making concerted efforts to help evacuate another 400, according to a statement by the organisation on Monday. Explosions and gunfire were heard in embattled cities in Ukraine on Monday as Russia's invasion met with stiff resistance. Sewa Europe, an independent partner organisation, and the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS) are currently working in ten Ukrainian cities. Sewa International has also released USD 10,000 for the Ukrainian relief efforts and started a Facebook fundraising campaign to help people who are caught in this humanitarian crisis, the release said. \u0093The messages and videos we are getting from the war zone show the fear, anxiety, and danger people are facing as they run to safety. As the global Sewa network rises to face this challenge, I request people to support Sewa International in this rescue effort,\" Arun Kankani, President, Sewa International, USA said. \"The war between Russia and Ukraine has affected all people in the region and caused serious distress in a world that is still struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sewa International in the USA, and HSS volunteers in Europe, the US, and India are receiving hundreds of messages seeking help from people who are stuck in the war zone,\" he explained. Sewa International helped a group of 150 students on February 26 to travel from Vinnitsa to Chernovtsy by bus. At Chernovtsy, Sewa provided them shelter, food, and transport for their onward journey to the Romanian border, the release said. According to official estimates, about 18,000 Indian students are studying in universities across Ukraine. Due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, they are currently stranded, facing a severe shortage of food, and are in dire need of transport and shelter. The Indian Embassy in Kyiv is advising these students on how to reach the country's western borders to reach Poland, Romania, or Hungary from where they can board Air India flights specially operated by the Indian government to reach India. According to latest information, a total of 1,396 Indian nationals have been brought back from Ukraine in six evacuation flights.",

        "description": "The IOC EB said it welcomes and appreciates the many calls for peace by athletes, sports officials and members of the worldwide Olympic Community",
        "content": "LAUSANNE, Feb 28: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday decided to withdraw the Olympic Order given to Russian President Vladimir Putin and two other top functionaries for the \"extremely grave violation of the Olympic Truce and other violations of the Olympic Charter by the Russian government\" by its invasion of Ukraine. The IOC's Executive Board (EB) took this decision during a meeting on Monday. Besides Putin, the Olympic Order has been taken away from Dmitry Chernyshenko, Deputy Prime Minister, and Dmitry Kozak, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office. The IOC had awarded the Olympic Order - Gold to Putin in 2001, while Chernyshenko and Kozak were given the same honour in 2014, the year Russia hosted the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Sochi. The IOC has also decided to withdraw the Olympic Order from all persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation or other government-related high-ranking positions. \"The IOC EB has, based on the exceptional circumstances of the situation and considering the extremely grave violation of the Olympic Truce and other violations of the Olympic Charter by the Russian government in the past, taken the ad hoc decision to withdraw the Olympic Order from all persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation or other government-related high-ranking position,\" the IOC said in a release after the EB meeting. The IOC EB said it welcomes and appreciates the many calls for peace by athletes, sports officials and members of the worldwide Olympic Community. The IOC admires and supports in particular the calls for peace by Russian athletes. \"The IOC EB reaffirms its full solidarity with the Ukrainian Olympic Community. They are in our hearts and thoughts. The IOC EB commits to continue and strengthen its efforts for humanitarian assistance. Therefore, the IOC EB has today established a solidarity fund. In this context, the IOC expresses its gratitude to the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and International Sports Federations that are already supporting Ukrainian athletes and their families,\" the IOC said. The IOC said it has taken these decisions because \"the current war in Ukraine, however, puts the Olympic Movement in a dilemma. While athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to continue to participate in sports events, many athletes from Ukraine are prevented from doing so because of the attack on their country\".

        "content": "KIEV, Feb 28: Facing massive cyber-attacks from Russia-sponsored threat actors, Ukraine has now assembled an 'IT army' tasked with specific cyber challenges, which reached nearly 2 lakh users on Telegram on Monday. Called the 'IT Army of Ukraine', it is also using the Telegram account to reach out to technology leaders to help the country fight Russian cyber-attacks and shut down Russian sites and their agents. \"A call out on the channel to shut down the API for Sberbank, one of Russia's major banks, appears to have come into play, with the site currently offline,\" reports TechCrunch. The Ukrainian government officials are also endorsing the 'IT Army', tweeting out the Telegram link. \"We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists,\" tweeted Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Digital Transformation. The cyber war between Russia and Ukraine has intensified, with Russia using a new destructive malware to permanently destroy data on systems belonging to Ukrainian organisations. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to hacking groups increasing their activities globally. While Russia-backed hackers have already hit several Ukrainian government websites and banks, a leading hacking group, Anonymous, has declared itself aligned with \"Western allies\", targeting operations in Russia. \"The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government,\" the group tweeted. According to the IBM Security X-Force team, they have obtained a sample of the new and destructive 'HermeticWiper' malware being deleted on Ukrainian systems. Belarusian state-sponsored hackers are also targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) said in a Facebook post that a mass phishing campaign is targeting the private accounts belonging to Ukrainian military personnel.

        "description": "India managed to accelerate its efforts to get its nationals out of Ukraine in the last 24 hours, though the situation on the ground continues to be \"complex and fluid\"",
        "content": "Depleting food stocks and long queues for water are adding to the trauma of stranded Indian students in war-hit Ukraine awaiting evacuation amid reports of some being roughed up by security personnel and spending freezing nights out in the open. As Indian and Ukrainian authorities on Monday described the situation as \"complex\" and \"very difficult\" in terms of evacuation of people, the students, joined by their parents, appealed to the Indian government to expedite efforts to evacuate them. Russia launched its attack on Ukraine last Thursday. \u0093I want my son in front of my eyes as soon as possible,\" said Kamini Sharma, who is praying for the safe return of Vibhor Sharma (22), a resident of Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Vibhor is pursuing a medical course at the Ternopil National Medical University. Payal Panwar, a final year medical student who returned to her Kotdwar home in Uttarakhand, said the stranded students need help of the Indian government and the Indian embassy people more while they are still inside Ukraine rather than when they have moved out of the war-torn country. \"The problems end when you cross the borders but while you are inside Ukraine it is really difficult with food supplies running out and no cash in ATMs. Stranded students need the help of Indian authorities while they are still inside Ukrainian borders,\" said Payal, who studies in Ivano-Frankivsk city in western Ukraine. Recounting her ordeal, she said around 60-70 Indian students had to book a bus and also walk a distance of 8-10 km in freezing cold to reach the Romanian border to get out of Ukraine. Many ATMs could not dispense cash and long queues of men and women waiting for their turn for food supplies were seen at several points, she said. Though happy and relieved to be reunited with her parents, Payal and her parents are worried about her brother who was still stuck in Kharkiv. An Indian student who managed to reach the Kyiv train station said Ukrainian guards were not allowing students to board trains and also beating up people and made a fervent appeal to the Indian embassy to evacuate them as soon as possible. \u0093It's getting difficult for us to stay here,\u0094 Ansh Pandita told PTI, as scores of Indian students, including women, sat huddled together at the teeming Vokzal railway station in the Ukrainian capital, holding a large tricolour aloft so they could be recognised in the crowd and also so no one from the group gets lost. The group of about 100 students managed to reached the station but no one could board a train. \u0093Ukrainian soldiers are not allowing us to board the train to Hungary. In fact, they are not allowing any international resident to get out,\u0094 Pandita, a student of Taras Shevchenko National Medical University in Kyiv, said over the phone from the station. \u0093We requested them to at least allow the girls to go but that request too fell on deaf ears,\" the student added. Congress also alleged that Indian students were assaulted by security personnel on the Ukraine-Poland border. \"Students are crying out for help, requesting the Modi government to intervene but to no avail. We saw a video last night on the Ukraine-Poland border where students are being beaten up,\" party spokesperson Ragini Nayak told reporters. India managed to accelerate its efforts to get its nationals out of Ukraine in the last 24 hours, though the situation on the ground continues to be \"complex and fluid\" in terms of evacuation of people, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. It said a total of 1,396 Indians were brought back home in six flights as part of the evacuation mission and the total number of Indians who have left Ukraine since India issued the first advisory earlier this month is around 8,000. An estimated 20,000 Indian nationals, mainly medical students, reside in Ukraine. As the battle for Kharkiv rages on, at least three students from Maharashtra pursuing medicine in the city located in northeast Ukraine, narrated how they had to stand in long queues for a can of water, drink soda, stay in bunkers, and risk their lives to fetch food items amid bomb blasts. Ambassador of Ukraine to India Igor Polikha along with Ambassadors from other countries, lights candles in solidarity with Ukraine amid Russia-Ukraine conflict, outside Ukraine Embassy in New Delhi (Pic: PTI) \u00a0 Hritik Bapulohar, a first-year medical student from Palghar, said he had reached Kharkiv city only a couple of months back. \"We can hear bomb explosions as they are taking place in a periphery of around 500 metres from where we are currently staying in Kharkiv. We are struggling even for basic needs. As many as 500 students are staying in two bunkers for the past four days.\u00a0When the curfew was lifted some of them left the hostel. The situation is worsening fast. I appeal to the Indian government to evacuate us urgently,\" he told a Marathi news channel. Bapulohar's senior Aishwarya Patil, who hails from Sangli, said drinking water stocks have exhausted at their Kharkiv hostel. \"We are currently using soda water for drinking. After standing in queues stretching up to 2 km, we can get a can of five-litre water. Food prices have tripled since the war began. We are taking huge risks by stepping out to purchase food items. We are hiding as bomb blasts are happening here. During nights, we are given an hour for cooking by authorities. We cook using mobile flashlights,\" she said. Shivanjali Yadav, also from Sangli, said students and other Indians are asked to stay in bunkers in Kharkiv even though we don't have much food and water with us. \u0093The students trapped in a bunker in the Kharkiv region are facing difficulties in arranging food, water. Some of them have fallen sick in freezing temperatures, few blankets, and dipping oxygen. There are also no transportation facilities available for them,\u0094 said one of the students who returned to Odisha. Several students wanting to return to India from Ukraine had to spend two days under the sky in severe cold weather at the Romanian border after travelling by bus and then walking for 25 km, a mother of one of the students said. \u0093My son somehow boarded a bus from Ternopil to reach Romania. But, on the way, he had to get down from the bus due to some problem and the border was still far away,\" the Indore-based Kamini Sharma, told PTI. The woman said her son along with several other Indian students walked for 25 km to reach the border of Romania. \"But, these students, gathered at the Romanian border, had to stay under the open sky for two days in the harsh winter weather as they were not allowed to enter Romania immediately,\" she said quoting the phone conversation with her son. Sharma said she has now come to know that clearance has been given for the entry of these Indian students into Romania on Monday morning. Ukrainian Ambassador Igor Polikha said his country is helping the stranded Indians and extending assistance in their evacuation notwithstanding the \"very difficult\" ground situation. Polikha said he himself reached out to some of the Ukrainian border guarding commanders requesting them to assist the Indians who are trying to exit the country through land borders. \"The situation is very difficult and complex. My resources are limited. We are victims of aggression. Still, we are trying to help people including those from other countries,\" he told a media briefing in Delhi. Polikha said the circumstances at the Ukraine-Poland border crossing are challenging as lakhs of people including diplomats, foreigners and Ukrainian citizens are queuing up to exit the war-hit country.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI, Feb 28: As Russia fails to inflict quick defeat upon Ukraine after four days of fierce hostilities, President Vladimir Putin is about to pull his Belarusian ally, dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko, into his war of occupation, The Kyiv Independent reported. Amid many speculations, multiple sources said the decision has been made, and as soon as on Monday, the first Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft is very likely to take off carrying Belarusian paratroopers to be deployed against Ukraine. Rumours regarding the official Belarusian involvement in the war started circulating on Sunday, the fourth day of Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, following a report presented to diplomatic circles by unnamed Belarusian opposition journalists, the report said. The message suggested that Belarusian troops might be deployed in Kyiv or the Zhytomyr areas in assistance to the Russian invading force. The report couldn't be verified, but there have been other indications of Belarusian military activity.A media campaign was launched, particularly by Belarusian opposition media, to warn off the Belarusian involvement. As part of the endeavour, former high-ranking Belarusian airborne commander Valeriy Sakhashik, in a video address, urged all Belarusian paratroopers not to obey unlawful orders that would throw them into a war against a friendly nation, The Kyiv Independent reported. Several thousand Belarusian citizens rallied against the war across the country on Sunday. Besides, as Ukraine's presidential advisor, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Sunday, numerous indications suggested that the Belarusian military was being put on alert. It is known from Belarusian media that the country's armed forces include nearly 45,000 military personnel and 20,000 civilian employees. In Arestovych's opinion, just 17,000 Belarusian military personnel are of considerable combat efficacy, so their involvement would likely not be that significant for Russia, which amassed at least 150,000 troops for the invasion of Ukraine. However, according to former Ukrainian Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, in reality, the Belarusian dictator, whose existence highly depends on Putin, has no choice other than to join, The Kyiv Independent reported. From the expert's perspective, Belarus' involvement would be an escalating factor, though it would not have a dramatic escalation effect in the war. In particular, Lukashenko might invade Ukraine's northwestern regions on which Russia is not currently focused. (IANS) Also Read: Brian Cox Calls Attention To Ukraine In His SpeechAlso Watch:\u00a0",

        "description": "Every year thousands of students from India go to Ukraine for medical education.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Every year thousands of students from India go to Ukraine for medical education. A big reason for this is the facilities and cheap medical courses offered to the students in Ukraine and the recognition given to Ukrainian universities across the world.The cost of medical education in a private medical college in Ukraine is half as much as in India, and the process of admission is also much simpler than in India. There are currently 14 major medical colleges in Ukraine in which more than 18,000 Indian students are pursuing MBBS and BDS courses. Out of these, about 1,000 have returned home while efforts are on to bring back the rest. Sandeep Dhamija, director of one of the country's renowned medical coaching institutes, says that compared to the number of seats reserved for medical course in Ukraine, few locals apply. This is the reason why medical seats are easily available to foreign students and Indian students get the benefit. Shirish Mehta, who did his MBBS from Ukraine, says that infrastructure in medical colleges of Ukraine is far better than in India, and also the cost of medical education in Ukraine is not even half of that of private colleges in India. The cost of medical education in government colleges in India, is around Rs 3 lakh per annum for each student. On the other hand, in private medical colleges of India, this cost goes up to Rs 20 lakh and may increase to Rs 30 lakh annually. In government medical colleges of India, where the cost of medical education for 5 years comes around Rs 15 to Rs 20 lakh, in private colleges, a student has to shell out more than Rs 80 lakh for the same. In several Indian private medical colleges, this cost goes over Rs 1 crore. On the other hand in Ukraine, a student doing MBBS has to pay about Rs 5 lakh per year, which takes the overall cost in five years to Rs 25 lakh. Indian educationist CS Kandpal says that one of the major reasons for the popularity of medical education in Ukraine is that students here do not have to take any separate examination to join these courses, whereas in India, NEET examinations are compulsory. Lakhs of students appear in the NEET exam every year, out of which only about 40,000 get admission in government medical colleges. In such a situation, a large number of NEET qualified Indian students turn to Ukraine. In Ukraine, NEET qualified students get admission easily and their ranking does not matter.

        "content": "World of Tanks developer Wargaming has rerouted company resources to support over 550 developers at its Kyiv studio as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its sixth day. Persha Studia was originally founded in 2000. It became Wargaming Kyiv in 2011 following its acquisition by Wargaming. The studio is the primary development hub of the F2P multiplayer title World of Warplanes. The company is currently helping staff in Kyiv find alternate housing, and sending early salary payments. It\u2019s also ensuring any travel and relocation efforts are paid for should staff need to evacuate quickly. Wargaming is throwing its support behind the Kyiv studio in a moment of political treachery. The company is headquartered in Minsk, the capital of neighbouring Belarus. Belarus, which has served as a staging platform for the Russian war effort, now seemingly moves to send troops to aid Russian forces. Wargaming joins a chorus of Belarusian voices and businesses strongly opposing its leadership\u2019s decision to ally with the Kremlin. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); In addition to ensuring its staff make it through the crisis, Wargaming is also donating US $1 million (A$1,377,724) in the studio\u2019s name to the Ukrainian Red Cross. Here\u2019s the statement from the press release: At Wargaming, the safety and security of our employees is the top priority. Currently, all available company resources are helping and supporting our 550+ colleagues: providing them with alternate housing, early salary payments, additional funds to aid travel and relocation. We are helping our employees\u2019 families to travel neighboring countries and organizing accommodation for them. And lastly, today Wargaming Kyiv are donating $1m to the Ukrainian Red Cross. These funds will be used to support Ukrainian hospitals and doctors, those citizens who have been displaced and other vital activities of the humanitarian organization as is needed. We will be able to proceed with further humanitarian help if situation requires. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); For more on the Ukrainian-Russia conflict, our friends at Lifehacker have put together a comprehensive explainer.

Vasily Nebenzya made the comments at a press conference at the emergency General Assembly to discuss Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 one which the ambassador had to halt to take a phone call. It came as sanctions continue to bite against Russia, with Finland even moving to block the sales of Russian vodka and as 12 Russian diplomats were accused of spying and told to leave the US. Referencing the war in Ukraine, Mr Nebenzya said: \u2018This is a special military operation, which it is commonly called. I wouldn\u2019t call it a war, because war means outright military hostilities. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live \u2018As you know, we announced it and we maintain that we\u2019re only targeting military objects in Ukraine, we do not target any civilian infrastructure.\u2019 The comments are despite unverified footage surfacing earlier today, claiming to show civilians lying dead in the street following heavy shelling in the residential areas of Kharkiv \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s second largest city. The International Criminal Court has also confirmed this evening that Russia will\u00a0soon be investigated\u00a0for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity over the conflict. Vasily Nebenzya told reporters 12 Russian UN diplomats have until March 7 to leave the US (Picture: AFP via Getty Images) The UN has met for a special, emergency General Assembly to discuss Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last week (Picture: AFP/EPA) In the same news conference, Mr Nebenzya revealed 12 UN diplomats have been ordered to leave the United States by March 7 \u2013 information the ambassador received over the phone during the briefing. He told the press: \u2018I have just received information that the US authorities have undertaken \u2026 action against the Russian mission to the United Nations, grossly violating the commitments in the cross-country agreement that they took.\u00a0 \u2018They\u2019re announcing 12 people from the Russian mission \u2026 and they are demanding that they will leave by March 7. \u2018They have just visited the Russian mission and gave us a note prescribing us to do what they demand. Russia-Ukraine war: Everything you need to know Fierce fighting has broken out in Kyiv as Russian forces descend on Ukraine's capital city. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for the Ukrainian army to\u00a0overthrow the democratically-elected government\u00a0in a chilling TV address. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00a0described the conflict as a \u2018catastrophe for our continent\u2019, and imposed a fresh sanctions package that personally targets Putin. However, the President has shown no signs of de-escalating anytime soon.

The news was later confirmed by Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the US mission to the UN, who said in a Twitter thread: \u2018The US has informed the Russian Mission that we are beginning the process of expelling 12 intelligence operatives from the Russian Mission who have abused their privileges of residency in the US by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security. \u2018We are taking this action in accordance with the headquarters agreement.

Prince Albert is home to the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Church and St. George\u2019s Ukrainian Catholic Church. Both congregations offered prayers during their weekend services as many locals are still trying to come to grips with what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. \u201cMany of the parishioners have relatives in Ukraine and various regions of Ukraine and, of course, everyone is worried for not only their loved ones but for everybody in the country and the surrounding regions who are all affected by this very tragic event and this humanitarian disaster,\u201d said Fr. Andrei Kachur with St. George\u2019s. The church said prayers in their Sunday service and Kachur said they will continue to do so in future services. Prayers were also offered at Holy Trinity as the community was offered to chance to pray for Ukraine on Saturday and Sunday. (Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Church Princ Albert/Facebook) Later in the week, there will be another opportunity for the city to come together to support Ukraine. \u201cThis Friday at Embassy Church will be an ecumenical service with the various religious groups in Prince Albert to pray for Ukraine,\u201d Kachur said. The city-wide prayer evening starts at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Embassy Church inside Plaza 88. \u2014 derek.craddock@pattisonmedia.com On Twitter: @pa_craddock",

        "content": "Calling Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine a \u201cgrave miscalculation,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlined on Monday how Canada is helping the defence effort in Ukraine while punishing Russia financially for its blatant transgressions. As of Monday morning, Trudeau said all Canadian financial institutions are barred from any transactions with the Russian Central bank. \u201cAnd we are prohibiting any direct or indirect dealings in Russian sovereign debt,\u201d he added. Trudeau also said Canada will move to ban all imports of crude oil from Russia. \u201cWhile Canada has imported very little amounts in recent years, this measure sends a powerful message,\u201d he explained. After sending supplies of body armour and night vision gear to the Ukrainian military on Sunday, Trudeau said more equipment, including anti-tank weapon systems and upgraded ammunition, were being shipped on Monday. \u201cThe whole world is inspired by the strength and intensity of their resistance,\u201d he said of the Ukrainian army\u2019s stalwart defence of its homeland. RELATED: Canadian banks banned from transactions with Russian Central Bank, feds say Despite that support, Trudeau stressed Canada is not involved in a combat mission in Ukraine. \u201cIt is clear that we are not going to be sending troops into Ukraine,\u201d he said. When asked what could prompt Canadian military involvement, Trudeau replied, \u201cThat decision is one to be made by our allies together. NATO is a defensive alliance \u2026 any decision to shift NATO\u2019s posture needs to be taken by NATO leadership itself.\u201d The Canadian Armed Forces will also be supplying airlift support to transport supplies and aid and to contribute to other NATO efforts, Trudeau said. Another measure of support will see the federal government fast-track immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada. \u201cPresident Putin has created a refugee crisis,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe said we would be there for the people of Ukraine and that includes making sure they can find safety here in Canada. \u201cIt is increasingly clear that President Putin has made a grave miscalculation,\u201d Trudeau said of the invasion, citing that the Russian Rouble has plunged to record lows while the Russian stock market has been forced to close.

The process routinely takes years to come to fruition, while a potential member has to meet assorted criteria to join, political and economical alike. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, for instance, said that while Ukraine is regarded as a part of the \u201chouse of Europe,\u201d its potential ascension was not something that could be done in a couple of months. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that we woke up in a different world just now because the European Union has always been a house whose doors were open,\u201d Baerbock said, adding that accepting Kiev into the bloc would not mean the latter seeks to sever the country from Russia. EU top diplomat Josep Borrell provided even a longer time frame for a potential ascension of Ukraine, stating that any membership bid could take \u201ca lot of years.\u201d Some leaders of the EU members, however, appeared to be more welcoming towards Kiev\u2019s aspirations. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the bloc needed to show a clear sign to Ukraine that it was welcome, while his Slovenian counterpart, Janez Jansa, expressed his \u201cfull support\u201d towards a speedier ascension procedure for Kiev.",

        "content": "The International Ice Hockey Federation has suspended Russia and Belarus from every age category in international play until further notice, the governing body said Monday, marking one of the most resounding sports-related sanctions levied against Russia and its allies since the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine began. The 2023 World Junior Hockey Championship, which was slated to be played in Novosibirsk and Omsk, will also be pulled out of Russia, the IIHF said, though a new location has not been determined. \u201cThe IIHF is not a political entity and cannot influence the decisions being taken over the war in Ukraine,\u201d Luc Tardiff, the IIHF\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cWe nevertheless have a duty of care to all of our members and participants and must do all we can to ensure we are able to operate our events in a safe environment for all teams taking part in the IIHF World Championship program.\u201d The IIHF Council has suspended all Russian and Belarusian national and club teams from IIHF competitions until further notice and withdrew the hosting rights of the 2023 #WorldJuniors from Russia. READ MORE: https://t.co/SpSMGTlZw1#hockey #icehockey #Ukraine #Russia #Belarus pic.twitter.com/YYb1JduvWE \u2014 IIHF (@IIHFHockey) February 28, 2022 The IIHF said it has \u201cnot left out the possibility\u201d of further actions impacting other events, but that it hoped for \u201ca swift and peaceful resolution to the war.\u201d The decision currently impacts the following events: \u2022 2022 IIHF Continental Cup \u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 World Championship \u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship \u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 Women\u2019s Word Championship \u2022 2022 IIHF World Junior Championship \u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey Women\u2019s World Championship The IIHF\u2019s decision comes as sporting bodies and athletes around the world have attempted to navigate the ongoing crisis, issuing restrictions and condemnations that have varied in their intensity. After FIFA, the highest governing body of soccer in the world, drew swift backlash from European nations for its initial response to Russia\u2019s invasion, it changed course on Monday, banning Russian teams from international competition \u201cuntil further notice\u201d in a joint statement made with UEFA. \u201cFootball is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine,\u201d FIFA said in its statement. \u201cBoth Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.\u201d Related articles: FIFA changes course, suspending Russian teams from international competitions IOC calls on sports organizations to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials Earlier on Monday, the International Olympic Committee\u2019s executive board urged sports federations and event organizers to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competitions. The recommendation came mere days before the Paralympics are set to begin on March 4. When doing so wasn\u2019t possible for \u201corganizational or logistical\u201d reasons, the IOC said everything in an organizer\u2019s power should be done to ensure that \u201cno athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus.\u201d According to the International Paralympic Committee, most of Russia\u2019s 71 athletes are set to compete and will have arrived in Beijing by Tuesday. Russia and Belarus continuing to participate in the Paralympics comes despite an open letter from Ukrainian athletes calling for the two countries to be banned from international sport, stemming from a \u201cclear breach of the Olympic and Paralympic Charters\u201d that \u201cmust be met with strong sanctions.\u201d The IOC also withdrew the Olympic Order \u2014 the highest award it can give, recognizing efforts worthy of merit in the cause of sport \u2014 from \u201call persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation,\u201d including president Vladimir Putin. Related video: Some high-profile athletes, from Russia and elsewhere in the world, have weighed in on the conflict as well. Canadian hockey legend Hayley Wickenheiser posted a picture on Twitter of a woman holding up a middle finger and wrote \u201cthis pretty much sums up how the world feels about your sanctions.\u201d and to \u201cGet out of bed with Putin and lead!\u201d Alexander Ovechkin, perhaps the most globally recognizable Russian athlete, called for \u201cno more war\u201d in his first public comments since the invasion began, though he stopped short of anything approaching a rebuke of Putin\u2019s hostility. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard situation. I have family back in Russia and it is scary moments,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do anything. We just hope it going to be end soon and everything is going to be all right.\u201d Ovechkin\u2019s prior advocacy for Putin has been well-documented. In 2017, he was part of a social media movement to support the Russian president, saying that to be part of his team was \u201ca privilege\u201d while posting a photo of him being embraced by the Russian leader. Ovechkin\u2019s current profile picture on Instagram at the time of this story\u2019s publication is still of him and Putin. For Russian athletes, public critique of Putin is not without risk. New York Rangers star Artemi Panarin has been a vocal critic of the Russian president and has indicated his support for Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader in Russia, on social media. After Panarin\u2019s comments supporting Navalny, a Russian tabloid printed allegations from a former coach that he attacked a woman in Latvia almost a decade ago, which he denied. The Rangers called it a fabricated story designed to intimidate Panarin for his political views. Andrei Nazarov, a former NHL enforcer who coached Panarin in the Kontinental Hockey League, said he was motivated to speak about the alleged incident because he disagreed with Panarin\u2019s repeated criticism of the Russian government. On the fifth day of Russia\u2019s invasion, here\u2019s how the sports world responded Since Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 23, sports federations, as well as athletes, have weighed in on the conflict. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what was said and enacted on Monday, the fifth day of the war. \u2022 FIFA and EUFA announced that they have suspended all Russian teams from international competition in response to the invasion, changing course after their initial sanctions against the country and its allies were widely chastised as being insufficient. \u2022 Canada Soccer said it would not compete at any level against Russia \u201cuntil sovereignty and territorial integrity are restored.\u201d \u2022 The International Olympic Committee \u201cstrongly urged\u201d sports federations and event organizers to not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions, in a decisive recommendation that comes as the 2022 Paralympic Games are set to begin. \u2022 Wayne Gretzky lamented the human toll of the ongoing crisis while zeroing in on what Edmonton, the host of the upcoming world juniors tournament, can do to make a difference. Still, other Russian athletes took swifter anti-war stances than Ovechkin. Andrey Rublev, a tennis player, wrote on a TV camera lens after sealing his spot in the Dubai Tennis Championships final \u201cNo more war please\u201d last Thursday as the conflict in Ukraine escalated, and added further emphasis to his thoughts in his post-match comments. \u201cIn these moments, you realize that my match is not important. It\u2019s not about my match, how it affects me,\u201d Rublev said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is much more terrible. \u201cYou realize how important [it] is to have peace in the world and to respect each other no matter what, to be united. It\u2019s about that. We should take care of our earth and of each other. This is the most important thing.\u201d The IIHF\u2019s removal of Russia and Belarus comes as the dire conflict in Ukraine stretches into its fifth day. The crisis began on Feb. 23, when president Putin of Russia declared the start of a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, signalling the beginning of a conflict many had feared would arrive for months as Russia amassed a military presence near the Ukrainian border. Belarus has been a launching point for troops throughout the baseless military operation, and is an ally of Russia in the invasion. Aleksandr Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has said he sees Russia and Belarus as not only neighbours and allies, but a single nation with the shared aim of warding off Western influence in former Soviet lands.

As of Sunday, at least 352 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed since the invasion began, according to the Ukraine Interior Ministry. \u201cWe were incredibly shocked to see the images that have come out of Ukraine,\u201d added Tardif. \u201cI have been in close contact with members of the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine and we hope for all Ukrainians that this conflict can be resolved in a peaceful way and without the need for further violence.\u201d",

The 42-year-old performer was in the capital city Kyiv filming World of Dance UA when Vladimir Putin launched an invasion on the country last Thursday (February 24). Maksim said that his arrest was the \u2018least traumatising\u2019 part of his experience and went on to add that he is focussing his attention on fleeing Ukraine. \u2018The streets are crazy,\u2019 he shared in a five-minute video posted to his Instagram page. \u2018At one point I got arrested but again all good, promise. \u2018That was probably the least traumatising moment in this whole thing as far as Ukraine is concerned, but for me, it was just a reality check.\u2019 Ukrainian-born Maksim \u2013 who lives in the United States with his wife and fellow Dancing with the Stars pro Peta Murgatroyd with their five-year-old son Shai \u2013 also explained that he is going to try to leave. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CahHOprgKPo/?utm_source=ig_embed He continued: \u2018I\u2019m going to try to make my way out, start trying to get close to the border.

I\u2019m a little nervous to be honest with you, but I think it\u2019s going to be all right. Well, I know it\u2019s going to be okay.\u2019 The TV star has been sharing updates regularly with fans since the start of the invasion and had previously explained that he was \u2018very scared\u2019 in a video which showed a passing army truck and in which sirens could be heard. \u2018This is the reality,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m in Kyiv, contrary to what I probably should\u2019ve done a while ago, and not that no one saw this coming, but everybody was hoping that the finality of this situation would be averted, that there wasn\u2019t going to be these kinds of aggressive measures.

        "content": "A Saskatchewan man who moved to Ukraine three years ago has found himself in the middle of a war. Bryce Walker \u2014 who lives in Rivne, roughly 350 kilometres west of Kyiv \u2014 joined John Gormley on Monday and recounted the day Russia began its invasion. \u201cIt was roaring. It was a low, constant roar,\u201d Walker recalled when describing the sound of fighter jets flying over his home. \u201cI looked at my girlfriend, she looked at me and we thought, \u2018OK, It\u2019s on. That\u2019s it, it has begun.\u2019 \u201d Russian military forces crossed into Ukraine last Wednesday night. Walker, a photographer, has been documenting his experiences of the conflict on YouTube. He says it\u2019s inspiring to see ordinary Ukrainians putting their lives at risk to defend their country against the Russians. \u201c(We\u2019ve seen) grandpas and grandmas throwing Molotov cocktails at tanks as they drive by,\u201d Walker told Gormley. \u201cWe got a grandfather standing in front of a column of tanks refusing to move, just like Tiananmen Square. These people are fearless.\u201d While there\u2019s no active fighting in his region, Walker doesn\u2019t have to venture far to see signs of the conflict, with military roadblocks and trains packed full of people fleeing the country. \u201cI have people that depend on me here so I can\u2019t just leave,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a zone where everyone is still on edge. Rocket attacks could happen at anytime. If the time comes that we have to run, we will, but that time hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d Reporter analyzes the scene in Ukraine As the war continues, a reporter who has been in the country since it was invaded joined Gormley on Monday to recount what he has seen so far. Nathan VanderKlippe with the Globe and Mail says he has witnessed a great amount of unification and mobilization by Ukrainian people as they defend their country. \u201cGas stations are giving away free gas to people who are using it to fill Molotov cocktails,\u201d VanderKlippe said. \u201cIt\u2019s really become a national effort.\u201d VanderKlippe now finds himself in Moldova, a small country nestled in between Ukraine and Romania. VanderKlippe says the country has seen a huge influx of people in a very short amount of time. \u201cWe\u2019ve now seen more than 70,000 people come into Moldova, which is a very small country,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 420,000 total Ukrainians have left the country amid expectations that this is just the beginning. We could at some point see a number that is 10 times that.\u201d The reason VanderKlippe is in Moldova is to get a better understanding of how officials of former Soviet Union countries are feeling as they see Ukraine people duel with the extensive Russian military. \u201cThis seems to be driving countries more rapidly into the arms of Europe as opposed to towards Russia, which, of course, was (President Vladimir) Putin\u2019s ambition,\u201d he said. VanderKlippe is also trying to find out how Ukrainian people plan on keeping themselves fed as the battle rages on. \u201cI\u2019m interested in trying to understand the supply lines that are being formed and maintained into Ukraine because there are reports from some folks that I spoke with that there are shortages of food in some areas,\u201d he said. \u201cCanned goods (are) starting to run low, grocery stores obviously can stock things for a while, but at some point, they\u2019re going to need to restock or the toll of human suffering is going to increase dramatically.\u201d As a refugee crisis looms, VanderKlippe says he has witnessed people come together to support Ukrainians in their time of need. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable how much generosity is being shown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe outpouring of generosity here has been absolutely staggering.\u201d \u2014 With files from 980 CJME\u2019s Logan Stein",

The post Jack Campbell dealing with \u2018mental block\u2019 in Maple Leafs\u2019 net appeared first on Sportsnet.ca.",
        "content": "The International Ice Hockey Federation has suspended Russia and Belarus from every age category in international play until further notice, the governing body said Monday, marking one of the most resounding sports-related sanctions levied against Russia and its allies since the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine began. The 2023 World Junior Hockey Championship, which was slated to be played in Novosibirsk and Omsk, will also be pulled out of Russia, the IIHF said, though a new location has not been determined. \u201cThe IIHF is not a political entity and cannot influence the decisions being taken over the war in Ukraine,\u201d Luc Tardiff, the IIHF\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cWe nevertheless have a duty of care to all of our members and participants and must do all we can to ensure we are able to operate our events in a safe environment for all teams taking part in the IIHF World Championship program.\u201d .acf-block-preview .instagram-twitter-container { width: 340px; margin: 0 auto; } The IIHF said it has \u201cnot left out the possibility\u201d of further actions impacting other events, but that it hoped for \u201ca swift and peaceful resolution to the war.\u201d The decision currently impacts the following events: \u2022 2022 IIHF Continental Cup\u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 World Championship\u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship\u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey U18 Women\u2019s Word Championship\u2022 2022 IIHF World Junior Championship\u2022 2022 IIHF Ice Hockey Women\u2019s World Championship The IIHF\u2019s decision comes as sporting bodies and athletes around the world have attempted to navigate the ongoing crisis, issuing restrictions and condemnations that have varied in their intensity. After FIFA, the highest governing body of soccer in the world, drew swift backlash from European nations for its initial response to Russia\u2019s invasion,\u00a0it changed course on Monday, banning Russian teams from international competition \u201cuntil further notice\u201d in a joint statement made with UEFA. \u201cFootball is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine,\u201d FIFA said in its statement. \u201cBoth Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.\u201d Earlier on Monday, the International Olympic Committee\u2019s executive board urged sports federations and event organizers to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competitions. The recommendation came mere days before the Paralympics are set to begin on March 4. When doing so wasn\u2019t possible for \u201corganizational or logistical\u201d reasons, the IOC said everything in an organizer\u2019s power should be done to ensure that \u201cno athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus.\u201d According to the International Paralympic Committee, most of Russia\u2019s 71 athletes are set to compete and will have arrived in Beijing by Tuesday. Russia and Belarus continuing to participate in the Paralympics comes despite an open letter from Ukrainian athletes calling for the two countries to be banned from international sport, stemming from a \u201cclear breach of the Olympic and Paralympic Charters\u201d that \u201cmust be met with strong sanctions.\u201d The IOC also withdrew the Olympic Order \u2014 the highest award it can give, recognizing efforts worthy of merit in the cause of sport \u2014 from \u201call persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation,\u201d including president Vladimir Putin. Some high-profile athletes, from Russia and elsewhere in the world, have weighed in on the conflict as well. Canadian hockey legend Hayley Wickenheiser posted a picture on Twitter of a woman holding up a middle finger and wrote \u201cthis pretty much sums up how the world feels about your sanctions.\u201d and to \u201cGet out of bed with Putin and lead!\u201d Alexander Ovechkin, perhaps the most globally recognizable Russian athlete, called for \u201cno more war\u201d in his first public comments since the invasion began, though he stopped short of anything approaching a rebuke of Putin\u2019s hostility. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard situation. I have family back in Russia and it is scary moments,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do anything. We just hope it going to be end soon and everything is going to be all right.\u201d Ovechkin\u2019s prior advocacy for Putin has been well-documented. In 2017, he was part of a social media movement to support the Russian president, saying that to be part of his team was \u201ca privilege\u201d while posting a photo of him being embraced by the Russian leader. Ovechkin\u2019s current profile picture on Instagram at the time of this story\u2019s publication is still of him and Putin. For Russian athletes, public critique of Putin is not without risk. New York Rangers star Artemi Panarin has been a vocal critic of the Russian president and has indicated his support for Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader in Russia, on social media. After Panarin\u2019s comments supporting Navalny, a Russian tabloid printed allegations from a former coach that he attacked a woman in Latvia almost a decade ago, which he denied. The Rangers called it a fabricated story designed to intimidate Panarin for his political views. Andrei Nazarov, a former NHL enforcer who coached Panarin in the Kontinental Hockey League, said he was motivated to speak about the alleged incident because he disagreed with Panarin\u2019s repeated criticism of the Russian government. On the fifth day of Russia\u2019s invasion, here\u2019s how the sports world respondedSince Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 23, sports federations, as well as athletes, have weighed in on the conflict. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what was said and enacted on Monday, the fifth day of the war. \u2022 FIFA and EUFA announced that they have suspended all Russian teams from international competition in response to the invasion, changing course after their initial sanctions against the country and its allies were widely chastised as being insufficient. \u2022 Canada Soccer said it would not compete at any level against Russia \u201cuntil sovereignty and territorial integrity are restored.\u201d \u2022 The International Olympic Committee \u201cstrongly urged\u201d sports federations and event organizers to not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions, in a decisive recommendation that comes as the 2022 Paralympic Games are set to begin. \u2022 Wayne Gretzky lamented the human toll of the ongoing crisis while zeroing in on what Edmonton, the host of the upcoming world juniors tournament, can do to make a difference. Still, other Russian athletes took swifter anti-war stances than Ovechkin. Andrey Rublev, a tennis player, wrote on a TV camera lens after sealing his spot in the Dubai Tennis Championships final \u201cNo more war please\u201d last Thursday as the conflict in Ukraine escalated, and added further emphasis to his thoughts in his post-match comments. \u201cIn these moments, you realize that my match is not important. It\u2019s not about my match, how it affects me,\u201d Rublev said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is much more terrible. \u201cYou realize how important [it] is to have peace in the world and to respect each other no matter what, to be united. It\u2019s about that. We should take care of our earth and of each other. This is the most important thing.\u201d The IIHF\u2019s removal of Russia and Belarus comes as the dire conflict in Ukraine stretches into its fifth day. The crisis began on Feb. 23, when president Putin of Russia declared the start of a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, signalling the beginning of a conflict many had feared would arrive for months as Russia amassed a military presence near the Ukrainian border. Belarus has been a launching point for troops throughout the baseless military operation, and is an ally of Russia in the invasion. Aleksandr Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has said he sees Russia and Belarus as not only neighbours and allies, but a single nation with the shared aim of warding off Western influence in former Soviet lands. On Monday, Lukashenko hosted the first face-to-face talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials since the start of the invasion, though president Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said he was not hopeful the meeting would lead to an end to the conflict. \u201cThis is not just Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cThis is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence.\u201d The people of Ukraine have waged a fierce defence of their country, slowing the Russian forces as they bear down on Kyiev, the capital of Ukraine. As of Sunday, at least 352 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed since the invasion began, according to the Ukraine Interior Ministry. \u201cWe were incredibly shocked to see the images that have come out of Ukraine,\u201d added Tardif. \u201cI have been in close contact with members of the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine and we hope for all Ukrainians that this conflict can be resolved in a peaceful way and without the need for further violence.\u201d",

        "description": "IOC action falls short according to Global Athlete movement",
        "content": "On Monday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board (EB) voted, in reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to recommend that International Sports Federations such as the UCI not allow athletes or officials from Russia or its accomplice in the invasion Belarus, to take part in their competitions.The actions don't go far enough in the opinion of Ukrainian athletes and the Global Athlete movement.Ukrainian athletes spoke out in a video message - some of whom said they arrived home from the Olympic Games and the next morning awoke to the Russian missile attacks. A letter posted on the Global Athlete accounts calling for the immediate suspension of the Russian and Belarusian Olympic Committees was signed by more than one hundred Ukrainians and international athletes like Canada's Clara Hughes, a former pro cyclist and speed skater, and British runner Paula Radcliffe. Read moreSivakov speaks out against Russian invasion of Ukraine Russian invasion of Ukraine earns condemnation from UCI Popovych ready to return to Ukraine to fight Russian invasion The letter decried the attacks, part of which were staged in Belarus, as a violation of international law and the Olympic Charter, which calls for a cessation of conflicts during the Games, and said the lack of swift action would embolden those countries.\"We plead with you to join the international community to sanction Russia and Belarus. The IOC and IPC must stand together and in solidarity with Ukrainian athletes to immediately suspend both Russia and Belarus,\" it stated.Global Athlete was founded by a group of athletes who were unsatisfied with the IOC's similarly weak response to the Russian state-sponsored doping. After Russian authorities tampered with doping test data, the country's athletes were still allowed to compete in Olympic Games as independents.The IOC EB did not suspend the Russia or Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, rather, it has avowed its \"full support\" to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), who will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to admit athletes from those countries into the Paralympic Games, which are due to start on March 4.On Monday, FIFA and the UEFA banned Russian teams and clubs from their competitions, but the UCI has yet to issue a response to the IOC recommendation. Should the UCI follow suit, Gazprom-RusVelo could be kept from racing the Trofeo Laigueglia on Wednesday and Tirreno-Adriatico this weekend.Imposing a ban on Russian athletes, however, is more complicated as several race on European teams. A ban would mean keeping Bora-Hansgrohe GC contender Aleksandr Vlasov and Belarusian teammate Alexandr Riabushenko out of Paris-Nice, Belarus' Alena Amialiusik (Canyon-SRAM) from racing Strade Bianche.Pavel Sivakov (Ineos Grenadiers) does not have any races on his near-term schedule due to a recent COVID-19 case, but he stated on social media on Friday that he is against the invasion saying, \"most of the Russians only want peace and never asked for all of this to happen\" and \"we shouldn't be targets of hate just because of our origin\". Putin's award revoked In addition to empowering federations to prohibit Russians in competitions, the IOC EB revoked the Olympic Order \"from all persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation or other government-related high-ranking position\", including Putin, who was awarded the distinction in 2001, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Chernyshenko and Dmitry Kozak, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office, both of whom gained the Order in 2014, the year of the Sochi Games.Applying sanctions to athletes, the IOC EB said, was \"a dilemma which cannot be solved\". It is unfair to punish athletes for the actions of their governments but equally unfair that Ukrainian athletes would not likely be able to compete in international competitions while their country is under attack.Instead, they asked the various sports federations to \"not invite or allow\" participation by Russian or Belarusian athletes and officials, and where it is \"not possible on short notice\", to allow participation but only as neutral teams or athletes.In \"very extreme circumstances\", organisations have been given a green light to find their own way \"to effectively address the dilemma described above\", the IOC EB wrote.The Russian Olympic Committee responded in a statement, according to Reuters, saying they intend \"to consistently uphold the rights and interests of Russian athletes and provide all necessary assistance to our national federations to challenge discriminatory decisions of the relevant international federations.\"",

Oleksandr Usyk and Vasiliy Lomachenko are not alone in taking up arms. Former heavyweight champs Vitali Klitschko and Wladimir Klitschko are also involved. Vasiliy Lomachenko and Oleksandr Usyk, two of the world's best active boxers, have joined Ukraine in the fight against Russia's invasion.Russia sent troops into the former Soviet nation Thursday and shelled several cities including Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, which is 25 miles from the border with Russia.Kharkiv's resistance began Friday, and has become a \"key battleground\" in Ukraine, Washington Post reported Monday.The country's key boxing figures have joined the war effort.Lomachanko, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-weight world champion boxer, joined a territorial defense battalion in Ukraine.Usyk, another Olympic hero who unified championship belts at cruiserweight and heavyweight, recently joined the Kyiv Territorial Defense and can be seen holding an assault rifle in one photograph.\"Good morning, my name is Usky Oleksandr,\" he said in one video this week. \"I want to appeal to the Russian people. If you consider us brotherly people, do not let your military, your children, go to our country. Stop attacking us!\"I also appeal to [Russia] President [Vladimir] Putin. Stop this war! Don't give us ultimatums and declare your conditions, just sit down at the negotiating table. We need to talk and stop everything.\"Our children, our mothers, grandmothers, and ordinary people, are hiding in basements,\" said Usyk.\"We are on our own land, we act as we have to, we are protecting ourselves. Stop it. Stop this war.\" A post shared by \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6LomUs\u2122\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@lomus_official) Both Lomachenko and Usyk are due to contest separate fights in the coming months, but it is unclear if the war effort will postpone those plans in boxing.Lomachenko had been linked to a lightweight title fight against George Kambosos Jr. in Australia, and Usyk remains contractually bound to a rematch clause to defend his newly-won heavyweight belts against Anthony Joshua.They are not the only boxers involved as legendary heavyweight Vitali Klitschko is a former champion who is now mayor of Kyiv.Klitschko's brother Wladimir, also a former champion, took up arms against Russia, as Insider previously reported.Insider was also ringside in Las Vegas for Saturday's Premier Boxing Champions event on Showtime Sports which featured a Ukrainian boxer, Viktor Postol, who lost to American fighter Gary Antuanne Russell.Postol said earlier in the week that he would fly to Ukraine after his match and protect his family.Read the original article on Insider",

Commenting on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the defense minister warned against using the word \u201cwar.\u201d He said there was no need for Bulgaria to side with Russia, the US, or European allies in the conflict, adding, \u201cOur suffering motherland does not deserve to be sacrificed in the game of the great powers.\u201d Read more Bulgaria insists it\u2019s a loyal NATO ally, but won\u2019t send troops to Ukraine Petkov chided him for the post, saying, \u201cNo minister can attempt to do foreign policymaking on his own, especially on Facebook.\u201d Yanev argued that he was being targeted for removal so the government could install a defense minister who will be more willing to serve foreign interests, in some cases at the expense of Bulgaria\u2019s security. Bulgaria was for long a close ally of Russia and was a Soviet satellite as a member of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War. However, the country joined NATO in 2004 and became part of the European Union in 2007. Petkov has said that standing in solidarity with Western allies is the best way to ensure Bulgaria\u2019s security. Moscow last week closed its airspace to flights from Bulgaria, after the Balkan country blocked Russian air carriers from its territory in response to the attack on Ukraine.",

After a weak opening, the 30-share BSE barometer plunged more than 1,025 points to the day's low of 54,833.50, before staging a recovery to close 388.76 pts or 0.70 per cent higher at 56,247.28, marking its second session of gains. On similar lines, the broader NSE Nifty climbed 135.50 points or 0.81 points to settle at 16,793.90. \"Aggravated Russia-Ukraine conflict along with fresh sanctions on Russia by global powers weighed on Western markets. Despite opening on a negative tone, domestic indices staged a strong recovery lifted by metal stocks and positive Asian markets. Metal stocks rallied on hopes that curtailing Russian exports would help Indian steelmakers to capture the export market share. Domestic investors are keenly awaiting the release of the Q3 GDP data later today,\" said Vinod Nair, head (research) at Geojit Financial Services. Ajit Mishra, V-P (research), Religare Broking Ltd, adds: \"Markets will first react to GDP data outcome in early trade on Wednesday. At this point, participants are keeping a close watch on updates related to Russia and Ukraine. Any fruitful negotiation outcome will boost sentiments, however on the flip side any dissatisfaction to either country, may once again impact markets worldwide.

        "description": "The actor-turned-politician has won admirers all over the world for bravely standing up to Vladimir Putin as his nation comes under attack.",
        "content": "Volodymyr Zelensky has become a hit across the world (Picture: Reuters|AFP|Getty Images) Three years ago, Volodymyr Zelensky was a comedian with little experience of politics.\u00a0 Now, Ukraine\u2019s president has emerged as a heroic war leader, whose brave defiance against Vladimir Putin has left fans swooning all over the world.\u00a0 The actor-turned-politician has been hailed an icon for refusing to leave Kyiv, despite Russian forces hunting him down in a bid to overthrow his democratically-elected government. Zelensky has rallied the nation with his moving addresses and video selfies standing up to Putin, who ordered his troops to invade Ukraine last week. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live He is said to have cooly told his US counterpart Joe Biden \u2018I need ammunition, not a ride\u2019 when offered the chance to escape Ukraine\u2019s capital city as it came under rocket fire. It was an admirable act of bravery from a man with no political involvement before his landslide presidential victory in April 2019. Before then, Zelensky\u2019s only political role was in TV show \u2018Servant of the People\u2019, in which he played a history teacher who is unintentionally elected as the president after a video of his character giving an anti-corruption rant goes viral. Before he was President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy created and starred in a Ukrainian show about a history teacher who accidentally becomes the president after one of his rants about political corruption goes viral. pic.twitter.com/colJWXN5TZ\u2014 The Recount (@therecount) February 27, 2022 From 2015-2019 Zelensky created and starred in the TV comedy series \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Servant of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u009d about a high school teacher who becomes Ukrainian President. Shortly after the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final season aired he won Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. Wild. pic.twitter.com/52gFhiLZzU\u2014 Peter Fox \u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00ba\u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00a6 (@thatpeterfox) February 26, 2022 But life soon imitated art for Zelensky when, on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2018, he upstaged the country\u2019s then-leader Petro Poroshenko and announced on live TV that he would be running for president himself. The following year he won the election with 73% of the vote. Poroshenko, a pro-Russian billionaire, lost to the television star across all regions of the country, including in the west where he traditionally enjoyed strong support. It was an extraordinary outcome to a campaign that started as a joke but struck a chord with voters enraged by poverty, corruption and a five-year war. At his campaign HQ, as the exit polls came out, ever-defiant Zelensky said: \u2018I will never let you down.\u00a0While I am not formally president yet, as a citizen of Ukraine I can tell all post-Soviet countries: \u201cLook at us! Everything is possible!\u201d.\u2019 Zelensky has won fans all over the world (Picture: Rex) Volodymyr Zelenskyy takes a selfie at the first congress of his party following his landslide election win (Picture: AP) Who is President Zelensky? Zelensky was born in January 1978 in the large Russian-speaking city of Kryvyi Rih, in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His Jewish family bore the scars of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, when more than one million Ukrainian Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust. Zelensky\u2019s grandfather fought in the Soviet Red Army against the Nazis in World War Two and was the only one of four brothers to survive the war. Zelensky wanted to move to Israel after finishing school but his father refused to let him go, instead sending him to study law at\u00a0Kyiv National Economic University. Zelensky is married to his childhood sweetheart Olena Zelenska (Picture: Getty) The former actor and comedian had no political experience before winning the 2019 election But it was comedy that captured his heart, and aged 17 he joined Ukraine\u2019s KVN TV comedy league, forming his own team Kvartal 95. After a few years of success that saw them travel to Moscow and a number of other ex-Soviet states, the Kvartal 95 comedy troupe founded its own production company, making films, cartoons and TV shows. But Zelensky\u2019s first big taste of fame came when he won his country\u2019s version on Dancing with the Stars in 2006. so apparently Zelenskyy won the Ukrainian version of Dancing with the Stars in 2006 and the tape is even better than whatever you\u2019re imagining pic.twitter.com/L1gnKD2ISr\u2014 Kat Abu (@abughazalehkat) February 27, 2022 Zelensky actually won Dancing with the Stars in 2006 (Picture: Youtube / Joel Thingvall) The revelation has left many wondering if there\u2019s anything he can\u2019t do (Picture: Youtube / Joel Thingvall) A now viral video of him jiving in a pink suit with flared trousers has left many wondering if there is anything he can\u2019t do. Zelensky grew up as a native Russian speaker but can also fluently speak English and Ukrainian. He starred in a number of hit rom-coms during his acting career, and even did the voice over for Ukraine\u2019s version of Paddington Bear. Until today I had no idea who provided the voice of @paddingtonbear in Ukraine. Speaking for myself, thank you, President Zelenskiy. #PaddingtonBear https://t.co/5VaMi201Fs\u2014 Hugh Bonneville \u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00ba\u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00a6 (@hughbon) February 27, 2022 Zelensky also did the voice over for Ukraine\u2019s version of Paddington Bear (Picture: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar) He was already well-known by the time he was cast in Servant of the People in 2015. But this role changed his life forever, becoming hugely popular amidst Ukraine\u2019s struggle with oligarchs and corruption. Then in a stunning turn of events, Zelensky announced in 2018 that he planned to follow his character\u2019s footsteps and run for president himself. Like his on-screen persona, Zelensky and his new party \u2013 also called Servant of the People \u2013 bypassed the traditional campaign. He ran his presidential bid almost solely on social media, by continuing to tour with Kvartal 95 and mocking his opponents in viral videos. His courage, good humour and grace has not wavered even in the face of the Russian invasion. Zelensky\u2019s defiant social media messages from the streets of central Kyiv have bolstered Ukraine\u2019s fierce resistance, with civilians all over the country taking up arms and making Molotov cocktails to fight back against Putin. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T26S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/25\\/17\\/54659595-0-image-a-14_1645810266033.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-25T17:29:32+0000\",\"description\":\"'We are here.

His defiance against the odds have made him something of an unlikely sex symbol. Admirers have been quick to compliment the father-of-two for his good looks and said his bravery had attracted them to him. Some think he may just be the sexiest politician in the world, a title unofficially held by Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau.

Homie is off the charts hot now.\u2019 However, Zelensky has not always enjoyed such populairty, His manifesto was mainly focused on ending corruption in politics and the war with Russian separatist forces in the Donbas region which broke out in 2014. But after his landslide victory, Zelensky\u2019s attempts to negotiate with Moscow to find a solution to the long-running conflict in the east of the country had only limited success, and last year his approval rating fell steadily. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the scene of conflict in the Donbass region (Picture: Getty) He has had an unlikely rise to success after starting out in acting and comedy (Picture: PA) His manifesto was mainly focused on ending corruption in politics and the war with Russian separatist forces (Picture: Nur) His links with the billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, who owns a 70% stake in the TV channel 1+1 which aired Servant Of The People, have come under question. And last year he faced another scandal when leaked papers showed he and\u00a0two of his closest advisers had a network of offshore companies across the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus and Belize. Zelensky had declared some of his interests before the election, but the investigation revealed he had transferred stakes to friends just weeks before he won to cover up his connections. When the US warned in December of a potential full-scale invasion by Russia, Zelensky said the threat was exaggerated, and many doubted his ability to lead the country through the crisis as tensions flared.

He began by describing a visit to a kindergarten in the east that had days earlier been hit by a missile. Then he said: \u2018When a bomb crater appears in a school playground, children have a question: \u201cHas the world forgotten the mistakes of the 20th Century?\u201d.\u2019 Communications consultant Yaryna Klyuchkovska says no Ukrainian leader had spoken so bluntly to the West before. Then, when Putin finally ordered his blitzkrieg, the leader stood firm. In a series of sombre video messages, an exhausted Zelensky has sought to reassure his people that troops will keep on fighting and he will not abandon them. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T5M16S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/26\\/15\\/54687933-0-image-a-2_1645887795967.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-26T10:41:00+0000\",\"description\":\"Zelensky thanked anti-war Russian celebrities for their activism, and invited anyone who wanted to stand against the invaders to join the fight.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/26\\/4442012057263030853\\/480x270_MP4_4442012057263030853.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T21S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/27\\/13\\/54714889-0-image-a-1_1645967138055.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-27T13:05:26+0000\",\"description\":\"Vitaly Shakun could not get out in time from his position on Henichesk bridge in the Kherson region so decided to sacrifice himself to cut off a key route for Kremlin troops.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/27\\/7331789853979554767\\/480x270_MP4_7331789853979554767.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video On Friday \u2014 with his sharp presidential suits replaced by military khaki green \u2014 he released a sombre video pledging to defend his capital against foreign invasion. In a self-shot video he said: \u2018We\u2019re all here. Our military is here. Citizens in society are here. We\u2019re all here defending our independence, our country \u2014 and it will stay this way.\u2019 In another video, looking weary but defiant, he shot down false claims from Russia that he had fled. Zelensky told the world: \u2018I am here. We are not putting down arms. We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this. Glory to Ukraine.\u2019 Many have compared his speeches to British wartime leader Winston Churchill. In a moving, Churchillian speech on the day Russia invaded he said: \u2018If we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces. Not our backs, but our faces.\u2019 Afterwards, Olga Rudenko, chief editor of The Kyiv Independent \u2014 who had previously called Zelensky \u2018dispiritingly mediocre\u2019 \u2014 tweeted: \u2018Today he is showing himself worthy of the nation he\u2019s leading.\u2019 President Zelensky has stayed in Ukraine despite his family being targeted (Picture: @zelenskiy_official) The father-of-two has been praised for his bravery in the face of Russian threats (Pitcture: @zelenskiy_official) Indeed, his refusal to cave into Russia has given other nations the confidence to dig their heels in. The UK, US, EU and Canada have struck an agreement to remove certain Russian banks from global payments Swift and introduced sanctions against the central bank of Russia. They have also supplied weapons and funds to Ukraine, with Germany sending anti-tank weapons and missiles in a major policy reversal. The Germans had previously said it held \u2018historical responsibilities\u2019 that prevented it from providing arms in conflict areas. All of this seemed inconceivable just a few weeks ago. From a besieged Kyiv, Zelenskiy has been constantly on the phone to western leaders, using his Twitter feed to encourage, scold and praise his allies. His defiance and resilience has left leaders all over the world impressed, perhaps none more so than Boris Johnson. He has spoken to Zelensky nearly every day since the invasion and is said to have told his counterpart that \u2018we are praying for you\u2019.\u00a0 Allies said that the premier \u2018tends to leave God out of things\u2019 but he was \u2018very moved\u2019.\u00a0 Following a phone call on Friday morning he remarked: \u2018Jesus, that guy is brave.\u2019 It remains to be seen how the war in Ukraine will progress. But as one leader\u2019s office told The Guardian: \u2018We are in awe of [Zelensky]. He may not eventually be able to save Ukraine,\u00a0or change Russia, but he is changing Europe.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at\u00a0webnews@metro.co.uk.

        "content": "Moscow seeks to \u201cdemilitarize and denazify\u201d Kiev, ambassador tells the UN General Assembly Russia seeks to save lives in the Donbass and punish those responsible for eight years of genocide and atrocities, Moscow\u2019s envoy to the UN Vasily Nebenzia told the General Assembly during a session called to denounce the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cOccupation of Ukraine is not part of our plans. The purpose of this special operation is to protect people, who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for the past eight years. This is why it\u2019s necessary to demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine,\u201d Nebenzia said. As one example of \u201cghastly crimes\u201d committed by the government in Kiev, the Russian envoy cited the murder of people protesting the US-backed coup in Kiev, when 40 people were burned alive in a building in Odessa. Moscow is seeking to bring to justice anyone who committed such atrocities, \u201cincluding Russian citizens,\u201d Nebenzia said. Russia is defending itself from a \u201cregime\u201d which \u201caspires to gain access to nuclear weapons,\u201d the UN envoy added, noting the statement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to that effect at the Munich Security Conference on February 18.\u00a0 Read more London takes back 'Putin regime change' claim Rather than violating the underlying principles of the UN, as critics have accused Russia of doing, Nebenzia argued the military operation is actually ensuring the key principle is upheld \u2013 to prevent another world war. NATO\u2019s placement of military assets in Ukraine would have forced Russia to take measures that would have put Moscow and the alliance \u201con the brink of conflict,\u201d he said. Ukraine and its Western backers have accused Russia of unprovoked aggression and dismissed accusations of genocide and atrocities in the two breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. \u201cEveryone knows that Russia and Russia alone started this invasion,\u201d said Kiev\u2019s ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya.\u00a0 The UN General Assembly is meeting at the request of the US, which last week submitted a joint resolution with Albania to condemn Russia at the UN Security Council, where it was vetoed by Moscow.",

The Ukraine international wished a \u2018painful death\u2019 on Putin last week after Russia launched a military campaign on his home nation across air, land and sea, a move of intense aggression which has been near-universally condemned around the globe. With the death toll in Ukraine rising, the International Olympic Committee has requested the heads and governing bodies of all sports to suspend athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus from participating in international competitions. FIFA are expected to impose a strict ban on Russia across all international football in the coming hours, meaning the national team will be unable to play at this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar.

The post reads \u2018no more Russia in international sport\u2019 in capital letters, with the following five demands. Oleksandr Zinchenko's five demands 1. Exclude Russia from all sports international governing bodies 2. Ban any Russian athletes from participating in any international competitions. 3.

Last week, Bryant called on the UK Government to seize the Russian-born billionaire\u2019s assets, including Chelsea which he has owned since 2003, as part of its sanctions against Russia. Over the weekend, Abramovich announced that he is giving up his \u2018stewardship and care\u2019 of Chelsea, although the day-to-day running of the club will remain unchanged. It has now claimed that Abramovich is attempting to broker a peace deal following Russia\u2019s invasion after Ukraine reached out to him via his Jewish contacts within the country. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live \u2018I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,\u2019 Abramovich\u2019s spokesperson told the PA news agency. \u2018Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.\u2019 Labour MP Chris Bryant has called for Roman Abramovich\u2019s assets to be seized (AP) But Bryant has questioned how Abramovich could be of any influence in negotiations between the two nations if Chelsea\u2019s owner is adamant that he is not closely connected to Vladimir Putin. In response to the news, Bryant posted on Twitter: \u2018This looks like another Russian lie in an attempt to avoid being sanctioned. \u2018If he\u2019s so close to Putin that he can wield such influence, if he\u2019s visited Putin this last week, he should be sanctioned now. \u2018Really? Doesn\u2019t peace just mean Russia withdraws?\u2019 More: FootballChelsea owner Roman Abramovich trying to broker peace deal with Russia and UkraineChelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah blasts referee over Naby Keita tackle'It is harsh' - Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel takes blame and explains Kepa decision Meanwhile, Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky has revealed that Abramovich \u2018has been trying to mobilise support\u2019 for peace talks but says 55-year-old\u2019s influence is \u2018limited\u2019. \u2018I can confirm that the Ukrainian side have been trying to find someone in Russian willing to help them in finding a peaceful resolution,\u2019 said Rodnyansky. \u2018They are connected to Mr Abramovich through the Jewish community and reached out to him for help. Mr Abramovich has been trying to mobilise support for a peaceful resolution ever since. \u2018Although Mr Abramovich\u2019s influence is limited, he is the only one who responded and taken it upon himself to try. \u2018If this will have an impact or not, I don\u2019t know, but I am in contact with Zelensky\u2019s staff myself, and know that they are grateful for his genuine efforts.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page.

        "content": "The Compare The Meerkat adverts have been a huge hit (Picture: Joe Pepler/PinPep) Comparethemarket has confirmed its Compare the Meerkat adverts will no longer air around news bulletins amid the Ukraine conflict. The price comparison website has issued a statement on its popular commercials \u2013 which feature animated Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov \u2013 following Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s ongoing invasion. A spokesperson for the company, which is owned by financial services firm BGL, said in a statement: \u2018The Comparethemarket meerkats are fictional characters. They have no association with Russia and the current situation. \u2018We are continually reviewing our advertising to ensure we\u2019re being sensitive to the current situation.\u2019 For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live The company is said to have adjusted its plans to ensure the adverts don\u2019t appear in potentially insensitive situations, such as TV news broadcasts focused on the conflict. The ads \u2013 which have run since 2009 \u2013 feature Russian billionaire Orlov from Moscow and sidekick Sergei, and the former\u2019s \u2018simples\u2019 catchphrase even entered the Oxford English Dictionary the following year. The animated character is voiced by Simon Greenall, known to Alan Partridge fans as Geordie Michael. Over the last year, Comparethemarket is estimated to have spent \u00a390 million on marketing in the UK, with around two thirds of that being focused on television campaigns. Meanwhile, Dave Barnett, managing director of media agency December 19, added: \u2018Brands need to be aware of context, the tone and timing of advertising.

Context is king, this has always been true, but never more so than when there is a major world event happening.\u2019 Meanwhile, other companies around the world have faced some pressure to adjust their branding and advertising amid the war. Some social media users have called on British supermarkets to rename their chicken kievs to chicken kyivs \u2013 in line with the Ukrainian spelling of its own capital city \u2013 as a show of solidarity. And US-based eatery Applebees had to apologise and pull adverts last week after a lighthearted commercial promoting its menu aired during news coverage. Got a story?

The leader has been calling for \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 entry into the EU to help his nation fight off Russian forces, who invaded the country last week. An image posted on social media shows him singing an official application at a desk with indoor barricades behind him. \u2018We ask the European Union for Ukraine\u2019s immediate accession via a new special procedure,\u2019 he said on his Telegram channel earlier on Monday, as fighting across the country intensified. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live \u2018Our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on an equal footing. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fair. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible.\u2019 The President of Ukraine has signed application for the membership of Ukraine into the European Union The plea comes on the back of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying on Sunday that the bloc wants Ukraine to join. \u2018They are one of us and we want them in,\u2019 she said. It is not yet clear what a special procedure would look like in practice and whether European leaders would agree to a fast-track option. The decision to add new countries to the EU lies with established member countries, which don\u2019t always agree with the Commission\u2019s views. European Council President Charles Michel said on Monday that there were \u2018different opinions\u2019 among member countries to discuss the matter. Ukraine is a close ally of the EU. In 2017 it signed an Association Agreement with the bloc, in which the two sides agreed to align their economies in areas such as workers\u2019 rights, and deepen political ties. Ukraine is also part of the bloc\u2019s Eastern Partnership and European Neighborhood Policy. Ukraine has called for a fast-track membership, though it is not clear how this would work in practice Brussels has been heavily supporting the nation after it came under attack from Russian forces. The bloc has announced it is sending weapons to Ukraine, banned Russian-backed media in the EU and banned Russian planes from flying its airspace. It has also announced a host of sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy, alongside the UK, US and Canada.

        "description": "Nikita Mazepin's future in F1 may well be out of his hands, with fresh calls to ban Russians from motorsport, and sport as a whole. The post Ukraine motorsport body asks FIA to ban Russian drivers appeared first on PlanetF1.",
        "content": "Ukraine\u2019s motorsport governing body has called on the FIA to ban Russian drivers from competing professionally, which would include Haas driver Nikita Mazepin. The letter submitted from the Automobile Federation of Ukraine [FAU] has requested that all drivers from Russia and Belarus \u2013 whose political leaders are supporting Russia in their invasion of Ukraine \u2013 be banned from international competition as a result. Also on Monday afternoon, an announcement from the International Olympic Committee [IOC] came which recommended international sporting organisations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing altogether. The FIA is officially recognised by the IOC within this remit so, should they decide to follow this guidance along with Ukraine motorsport\u2019s request, this would result in Mazepin being banned from the grid in 2022. A relevant portion of the IOC statement reads: \u201cIn order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants, the IOC EB [International Olympic Committee Executive Board] recommends that International Sports Federations and sports event organisers not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions.\u201d FAU president Leonid Kostyuchenko sent his letter to Mohammed Ben Sulayem, responding after the FIA president had written to Ukraine\u2019s motorsport body to offer his \u201cfull support and the support of the FIA\u201d in their current plight. Should the FIA go ahead with banning Russian drivers from international competition, this would see Mazepin definitively lose his seat with Haas, with his future already uncertain after Haas opted to run without branding from their title sponsor and Russian firm Uralkali, owned by Mazepin\u2019s father Dmitry. Requests to the FIA from Kostyuchenko include: \u2013 Prohibit the holding of FIA and FIA-authorised competitions on the territory of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. \u2013 Exclude from the FIA \u200b\u200ball members from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. \u2013 To exclude from the FIA \u200b\u200bcommissions all persons representing organisations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. \u2013 Prohibit holders of all licenses issued by the RAF and BAF [Belarusian Automobile Federation] from competitions outside the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. \u00a0 Haas team principal Guenther Steiner admitted that Mazepin\u2019s future with the team \u201cneeds to be resolved\u201d in the coming days and weeks, but the Russian is currently still due to run in the VF-22 in the official Formula 1 pre-season test in Bahrain from 10-12 March. This season\u2019s Russian Grand Prix is also in doubt after Formula 1 released a statement to say that, in the current situation between Russia and Ukraine, the race in Sochi is \u201cimpossible to hold\u201d. \u00a0 \u00a0 The post Ukraine motorsport body asks FIA to ban Russian drivers appeared first on PlanetF1.",

As shown in the press release photos directly above and at the top of this article from Tobu Group (the Skytree\u2019s owner), the Skytree has three different standard color patterns. The one on the left is called \u201cIki\u201d (meaning \u201cchic\u201d), and its colors are meant to be evocative of spray forming on the waters of the Sumidagawa River (the officially stated colors are blue and white), Tokyo\u2019s major transportation vein during the Edo period. Iki, along with Miyabi and Nobori (the names of the other two color patterns), entered into rotation for the Skytree in February of 2020, in anticipation of the influx of overseas visitors Japan was expecting for the Tokyo Olympics. Since then, they\u2019ve been on a steady three-day rotation, barring any special illumination patterns, and Saturday just happened to be when Iki\u2019s turn came up again. \u25bc \u201cToday\u2019s lighting is Iki,\u201d tweeted the Skytree\u2019s official account on Saturday morning. Sunday\u2019s pattern was Miyabi, Monday\u2019s was Nobori, and a special sakura color pattern runs from March 1 to 9.

A Skytree public relations representative also confirmed to Huffington Post reporters that the color pattern was not meant to have any connection to the situation in Ukraine. A number of Twitter users responded to the embassy\u2019s tweet by pointing out the preexistence of the Iki color pattern and schedule. All the same, many others who saw the Skytree on Saturday night, or the photo posted by the embassy the next day, had their thoughts drawn to the Ukrainian people, and their hope for a swift and peaceful end to the conflict, with reactions including: \u201cEven if it\u2019s a coincidence, a light of encouragement was shining from the tallest tower in Japan.\u201d \u201cThe end result is still deepening the bond between our country and Ukraine, and I have faith that they will know peace again.\u201d \u201cWhether it was part of the regular rotation or not, when a lot of people saw the coloring it made them think of Ukraine, and that\u2019s important.\u201d \u201cIf this gives the Ukrainian people even a little bit of courage, then I think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Meanwhile, across town in the Shinjuku district, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (also known as Tocho) actually is lit up in the colors of the Ukrainian flag in a deliberate show of solidarity. \u3010#\u90fd\u653f\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3011#\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca \u3068\u306e\u9023\u5e2f\u3092\u793a\u3059\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u5e81\u7b2c\u4e00\u672c\u5e81\u820e\u3092\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u56fd\u65d7\u306e\u8272\u3067\u3042\u308b\u9752\u3068\u9ec4\u8272\u306b\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u671f\u9593\uff1a2\u670828\u65e5\uff08\u6708\uff09\uff5e3\u67086\u65e5\uff08\u65e5\uff09\u6642\u9593\uff1a18\u6642\uff5e23\u6642 pic.twitter.com/fUbY2YxjdH\u2014 \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u5e81\u5e83\u5831\u8ab2 (@tocho_koho) February 28, 2022 \u90fd\u5e81 \u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u56fd\u65d7\u306e\u8272\u306b\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7 pic.twitter.com/oyI5aNibCb\u2014 \u8e0a\u30a6\u30bf\u30de\u53e3(\uff86\uff70) (@utamaro_) February 28, 2022 While it can\u2019t claim \u201ctallest structure in Japan\u201d status, at 242.9 meters (797 feet) tall Tocho is still a massive presence, and the fact that it\u2019s an actual governmental facility arguably makes the gesture more significant than one from the Skytree would be. \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u5e81\u304c\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u67d3\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u9023\u643a\u793a\u3059\u3010\u753b\u50cf\u96c6\u3011 https://t.co/TwmmNiYFBw pic.twitter.com/eviLHaLqTU\u2014 \u4e43\u6728\u5742\uff06\u6b05\u5742\u30d1\u30ea\u30d4 (@paripikohei) February 28, 2022 The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is scheduled to be illuminated in blue and yellow until March 6 from 6 to 11 p.m. nightly.

        "content": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine\u00a0began last week, while Putin warned of retaliation of any other country that attempted to intervene. Countries around the globe have instead put up\u00a0sanctions against Russia that have prevented money from flowing in and out of the country. This has now impacted OnlyFans content creators in Russia who have had their accounts blocked or removed from the platform.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesPer The Daily Beast, OnlyFans has reportedly begun blocking and deleting accounts in Russia following the invasion of\u00a0Ukraine last week. There isn't much information on whether this was motivated\u00a0by\u00a0political reasons or if it was a result of the sanctions being imposed on Russia. Many OnlyFans creators are now losing significant income due to the platform's recent move.One OnlyFans user, who goes by @kitty on OF, told the Daily Beast, \"Right now I don\u2019t have any funds to buy food or pay my rent.\" Adding, \"I have taken part in several protests since I moved to Moscow when I was 18. We are not Putin! All my prayers for peace and the Ukraine people.\" Other users have also expressed that they do not support the war and feel they're being unfairly treated for Putin's actions.OnlyFans has since responded to the backlash, though they didn't explain why accounts are being blocked. \"Any available balances will remain secure and pending until such time that they may be withdrawn again,\" OF said. \"While creators are not responsible for the recent attacks on Ukraine, due to worldwide financial restrictions we have very limited methods to pay Creator accounts linked to Russia and Belarus.\"OnlyFans added that \"payments are limited\" due to the financial restrictions including access to SWIFT. The global financial network allows money to transfer across the world but Russia now has to work directly with financial institutions.\u00a0[Via]",

        "content": "Athletes representing the Russian Olympic Committee march in the opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.AP Photo/Jae C. Hong The International Olympic Committee has recommended bans for Russian and Belarusian athletes. Monday's statement from the Olympics governing body comes as Russia's Ukraine invasion intensified. The IOC also moved to remove Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials from the Olympic Order. The International Olympic Committee has taken its most serious measures yet to rebuke Russia and Belarus for their involvement in the war in Ukraine.In a statement published Monday, the governing body for the Olympics recommended \"with a heavy heart\" that sports federations across the globe ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in international sporting events, including the upcoming games, world championships, and more.An athlete representing the Russian Olympic Committee points to his ROC logo during the Beijing Olympics.AP Photo/Francisco SecoThough the IOC insisted that \"the Olympic Movement is united in its sense of fairness not to punish athletes for the decisions of their government if they are not actively participating in them,\" the committee noted that \"the current war in Ukraine, however, puts the Olympic Movement in a dilemma.\"\"While athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to continue to participate in sports events, many athletes from Ukraine are prevented from doing so because of the attack on their country,\" the IOC statement read. \"This is a dilemma which cannot be solved.\"Due to this severe breach of the Olympic Truce, therefore, the committee resolved\u00a0\"that International Sports Federations and sports event organisers not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions.\"Gold medalists of team ROC pose for a group photo during the flower ceremony of the figure skating team event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.Zhang Yuwei/Xinhua via Getty ImagesThe IOC also withdrew the Olympic Order \u2014 the most prestigious honor issued by the committee \u2014 from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several other high-ranking officials from his country, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko and Deputy Chief of Staff Dmitry Kozak, faced similar punishment.The move comes mere weeks after Putin traveled to China's capital to watch the opening ceremony for the 2022 Winter Olympics first-hand at Beijing's National Stadium. Though Russian athletes technically competed on behalf of the Russian Olympic Committee due to past doping violations, Putin stood and applauded as the ROC made its appearance.Russian President Vladimir Putin stands and gestures as the Russian Olympic Committee athletes arrive at this year's Opening Ceremony.AP Photo/Sue OgrockiWhether individual sports' governing bodies heed the IOC's call to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from their events remains to be seen. The International Ice Hockey Federation appears to be on the verge of throwing Russia and Belarus out of its ranks, per hockey reporter Pekka Jalonen.FIFA, which governs international soccer competitions, including the World Cup, stopped short of banning any nation in its most recent responses to the crisis in Ukraine. The Russian national team will not be permitted to play any matches on its home turf, nor will they compete under the Russian flag in upcoming World Cup qualifiers. Instead, they will be referred to as RFU, according to ESPN.It remains unclear whether FIFA will increase the severity of its response to match the IOC's latest recommendations.Putin touches the World Cup trophy at the 2018 final in Moscow.AP Photo/Petr David JosekRussia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 which has been aided by neighboring Belarus \u2014 has intensified in recent days. Putin's forces have looked to seize control of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in what is considered Europe's most serious ground war since World War II.While the reaction across the sports world has been swift, the political world's response does not appear to have deterred Putin from directly violating Ukraine's sovereignty. The result will likely have dire consequences across the globe.Insider's live blog of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0is covering developments as they happen.Read the original article on Insider",

Usyk, who took the IBF, WBO and WBA heavyweight titles from Joshua in September, returned to Ukraine last Thursday following the Russian invasion of his homeland. The 35-year-old has since joined Ukraine\u2019s territorial defence forces to defend his country, following countryman Vasily Lomachenko in taking up arms in response to the conflict with Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko also vowing to join the fight. Joshua activated a rematch clause immediately following his comprehensive defeat to Usyk last September with talks ongoing over when that fight will take place.

        "description": "Shows of solidarity with Ukraine on the field are made more complicated by entanglements between clubs, organizations and Russian leadership.",
        "content": "Shows of solidarity with Ukraine on the field are made more complicated by entanglements between clubs, organizations and Russian leadership.View the original article to see embedded media.Initially, at least, the statement was bewildering. Roman Abramovich was \u201cgiving trustees of Chelsea\u2019s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.\u201d It was soon clarified that he remains the owner and that there were numerous complications about passing the club over to its trustees. But the question remained: What was going on?Clearly, this means something. It\u2019s probably an attempt to distance the club from Abramovich should he become the subject of sanctions imposed by the U.K. government\u2014of course, he has always downplayed his links to Vladimir Putin, and there seems, at the moment, to be only a slim possibility that Chelsea could be involved. After all, while Chelsea has clearly benefited enormously from Abramovich\u2019s investment\u2014he has loaned the club \u00a31.5 billion without taking repayment\u2014it would take a government even more out of step with public opinion than this one to risk bankrupting the European champion. Adam Davy/PA Images/Imago Images Then, after his insistence that he is not involved in politics, Abramovich was revealed to be involved in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. \"I can confirm that the Ukrainian side have been trying to find someone in Russia willing to help them in finding a peaceful resolution,\" said the film director Alexander Rodnyansky.\"They are connected to Roman Abramovich through the Jewish community and reached out to him for help. Abramovich has been trying to mobilize support for a peaceful resolution ever since. Although Abramovich's influence is limited, he is the only one who responded and taken it upon himself to try. If this will have an impact or not, I don't know, but I am in contact with [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskyy's staff myself, and know that they are grateful for his genuine efforts.\"There are political games being played on all sides here, and it\u2019s far from clear what Abramovich\u2019s role is. Chelsea was criticized for the brief statement it released on Sunday that referred to the \u201csituation in Ukraine\u201d as \u201chorrific and devastating\u201d without mentioning Russia or referring to a \u201cwar\u201d or an \u201cinvasion.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely Abramovich had any direct input into that, and, particularly given how low-profile he has always remained, it\u2019s implausible that he should make any public statement on the conflict. He, like the other oligarchs, must tread a fine political line between Putin on the one hand and the general global political opinion on the other.Football, more generally, has become a stage for demonstrations of solidarity. That can at times feel absurd, but as the most global cultural mode, it is probably inevitable. The demonstrations of solidarity with Ukrainian players and the displays of Ukrainian flags may mean little practically, but they are at least a gesture to people in Ukraine that they are neither forgotten nor alone.These are not, though, straightforward issues. Moving as the scenes of support for Ukraine before Everton\u2019s defeat to Manchester City were (both sides feature Ukrainian players), Everton has ties with Alisher Usmanov, another oligarch who has denied involvement with Putin, while Man City is owned by Sheikh Mansour, a representative of the UAE government, which abstained in a vote against sanctions for Russia at the United Nations.That symbolic power is relevant also to the ongoing wrangling about Russia\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Poland, which is scheduled for next month, with the winner to play either Sweden or the Czech Republic for a place in Qatar. All three of those nations have made clear they will refuse to play and have rejected FIFA's initial attempt to circumvent the issue by having Russia play on neutral ground under the name of the Russian Football Union. ZUMA Wire/Imago Images England, Scotland and Ireland have all said they will refuse to play Russia, which creates issues for this summer\u2019s women\u2019s Euros, hosted by England and for which Russia has qualified, and may signal a broader militancy on the part of UEFA. If that is the case, it\u2019s hard to see how FIFA can do anything other than expel Russia, rather than risk a mass European boycott of the World Cup (which itself has ramifications for the ongoing political battle between FIFA and UEFA).UEFA, meanwhile, having moved the Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris, must make a decision on the continued involvement of Spartak Moscow in the Europa League. It is scheduled to play away to RB Leipzig next week, but it seems unlikely that game will happen, not just because of the reluctance of the German authorities to admit a Russian team, but because of the near-impossibility of travel. Reports suggest the club will be expelled, with Leipzig given a pass to the quarterfinals.The tendency of sports governing bodies, understandably, is to avoid political involvement where possible. FIFA and UEFA don\u2019t like to be arbitrating on whether conflicts cross some line after which they must take action. But this is one of those occasions when action is unavoidable.More Soccer Coverage:FIFA Announces Russia Must Play at Neutral Venues, Under RFU NameAbramovich Reportedly Involved in Russia-Ukraine Peace TalksPoland, Czech Republic, Sweden Refuse to Play Russia in WCQ Playoff",

        "content": "Yaroslav Popovych has made an emotional plea for aid for Ukraine and suggested he could even return home to fight the Russian invasion, with Andrei Tchmil also ready to defend his bike factory in neighbouring Moldova if Russian troops cross the border from nearby Odessa. Popovych is from Drohobych in the west of the Ukraine. He moved to Italy when he was young and became amateur world champion in 2001. He went onto finish third in the 2003 Giro d\u2019Italia and eighth in the 2007 Tour de France before becoming a trusted directeur sportif at Trek-Segafredo. He was with the American team at the UAE Tour when Russia invaded Ukraine. He slept little as he tried to help his family and friends from afar and now is helping send vital supplies to Ukraine from his home in Italy.

I hesitated a lot in 2014 [during the annexation of Crimea by Russia, ed], when I was still a rider. I told my wife Friday night and she is very upset. Yet I feel it inside of me, I can't do nothing. Yeah, I'm scared of course, but in 2014 people were under bombs every day, even though a lot less people were talking about it, and I didn't go there. Today, I don't want to hide anymore.\"Popovych explained in his Instagram video how a Polish bike owner he met at the Tour de Pologne eight years ago reached out to him and helped some friends travel from Poland to Italy.\"It was an example of how one person helped another person with the click of the fingers,\" Popovych said.\"In my life I've always never asked for help. I have a lot but I don't ask for help. But now I'll do some lists of things we need for the Ukrainian people. If you can help us, it'll be really nice.\"With my wife and friends in Italy we've already arranged a lot of things. For sure we need some food, clothing and some medical stuff. If you can help it we will send it from Florence and again in the days ahead.\"If you want to help the Ukrainian people and especially Ukrainian kids, try to find on the internet in your country the people who can help.\"Popovych ended his emotional video with the Ukrainian national salute: \"Slava Ukraine - Glory to Ukraine.\" A post shared by Yaroslav Popovych (@yaropopovych)A photo posted by on (Image credit: Roberto Bettini/BettiniPhoto\u00a92013) Tchmil stays in Moldova despite proximity to Ukraine Andrei Tchmil called former rival Johan Museeuw on Sunday explaining how he had taken his young wife and one-year-old child to Romania but returned to the Moldova capital Chisinau to defend his eponymous bike business and his country.Tchmil was born in the Soviet Union and has held Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian nationality. He became a naturalised Belgian during his professional career and won Paris-Roubaix in 1994, Milan-San Remo in 1999 and the Tour of Flanders in 2000. He managed the Katusha team for several years but returned to Moldova to manage a growing bike factory.\"'We used to fight a lot of wars on bicycles, but now I'm in the middle of a war', Andre told me. 'I live on the border area 100 kilometres from where there is fighting',\u201d Museeuw said according to Flemish media.\"He (Tchmil) said he sent his wife and their one-year-old son away to Romania to protect them, but that he is going to stay there. \u2018I'm going to fight. I'm going to defend it.\u2019 he said.\"Johan, I wanted to hear from you again. I don't know if I'll be there tomorrow or the day after. I hope so, but I'll give you a big kiss.\"Museeuw was moved by Tchmil\u2019s message saying: \"Andrei, thanks for the call and I really hope from the bottom of my heart that we can keep calling each other.\"On Monday, Tchmil explained to Het Laatste Nieuws that he will fight to keep his bike factory running even if orders have dried up.\u201cWe no longer sell bicycles, nobody orders a bicycle anymore. We have no contracts, no future. I keep my people employed because I don't want to let anyone down. I hope nothing happens to us. We are a ship adrift. We try to steer a course, but damn it, we can't.\"Tchmil understands his situation is very precarious. He could escape to Belgium but for now is determined to stay. \u201cChisinau is 185 kilometres from Odessa. We are 75 kilometres from Transnistria, where Ukraine has an important military airport. The Russians will be there on Monday. For me the situation is very complicated. The border is close.\u201cWhat happened in Ukraine is happening almost here, in Moldova. Moldova cannot go to war. We don't have an army. Moldova is neutral. It could just happen that someone decides to take Transnistria which is three quarters of an hour from here.\u201d\u201cA lot of people have called me. I heard Johan Museeuw, Peter Van Petegem. I tell them: where can I go? If I want to leave. Then I take my Belgian passport and come to Belgium. But for now I will stay here.\u201d",

        "content": "A call has been issued for ordinary people and foreign nationals to join Ukraine\u2019s resistance (Picture: AP/Mikhail Palinchak/Efrem Lukatsky/Marcus Yam/ LA Times/Shutterstock) Volunteers from across the world are joining Ukraine\u2019s resistance to the Russian invasion after a call to arms by the government. A Ukrainian veteran about to start a new job as a lorry driver in Canada is among those who have made the journey to try and repel Vladimir Putin\u2019s multi-pronged attack on the country. In London, British nationals have turned up outside the Ukrainian embassy insistent on becoming combatants. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has urged people without military training or experience not to join the fighting. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live However, a mix of non-resident Ukrainians and foreigners, said to include 60 British volunteers expected to arrive in the next few days, have decided to make the journey. On Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for foreign nationals to fight against \u2018Russian war criminals\u2019 and announced a special unit for international recruits. Alexander Khara, a defence analyst, told how his brother-in-law has joined the regular forces after abandoning a new job as a lorry driver in Canada. Mr Khara said his relative is a veteran of the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbass region which broke out in 2014. Mr Khara, a former government official who is currently based 40km to the west of Kyiv, said: \u2018We have amended our law on defence and military service and there is a possibility for foreign nationals to serve in the Ukrainian army and to defend Ukraine. \u2018In the beginning, in 2014, a lot of guys were pouring into Ukraine from across Europe and fighting on their own. At that time it was illegal but the state didn\u2019t care because it wasn\u2019t able to protect itself in the beginning. \u2018Now we have this legislation and it is possible for these guys to fight against Russians. A lot of people are showing an interest in fighting.\u2019 {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T1M52S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/28\\/11\\/54752617-0-image-a-1_1646048008616.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-28T11:31:31+0000\",\"description\":\"A foreign legion of fighters who are travelling to Ukraine include British volunteers and a man taking annual leave from his job in Canada.

Those interested in joining the frontline are being advised to contact the defence attache of the country\u2019s embassies in their home nations. Routes into the Ukrainian forces and the attached units for overseas fighters stretch back to the outbreak of the conflict against the rebels. With the Russian assault along multiple axes cutting key air and ground routes into Ukraine, they now face challenges reaching the conflict zone. \u2018At the moment it\u2019s quite difficult to get to Ukraine because the airlines have shut the flights to Kyiv,\u2019 Mr Khara said. \u2018One of the key routes is via Poland, so people are flying from across the globe to Warsaw and then, either by railway or cars or buses, they are getting into western Ukraine and then depending which military unit or territorial defence unit they want to join they are choosing the way. \u2018Lviv is the most western city in Ukraine on the same line as Kyiv but unfortunately some Russian troops from Belarussia have infiltrated this highway\u2026so you need to go south. My relative abandoned his newly-acquired job in Canada and he flew to Paris, where he met a couple of other guys from different countries. \u2018One of them I drove to a village near Bucha, where there were checkpoints and people getting ready for Russian saboteurs. He\u2019s a military doctor and he said he would join the armed forces.\u2019 Members of the Georgian Legion at their base in Kyiv before the Russian invasion was launched (Picture: AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) Ukrainian civilians wait for their turn to join the ranks of the city\u2019s territorial defence in Kyiv (Picture: AP Photo/Mikhail Palinchak) Mr Khara told Metro.co.uk the man he assisted had a well-paid job in North Africa but has taken a holiday to join the resistance to an invasion estimated to involve 150,000 Russian troops. \u2018He took vacation to join this fight and a lot of other guys are pouring into Ukraine,\u2019 Mr Khara said. \u2018My relative is joining the 72 Army brigade. He has combat experience since 2014 and he wants to join the army but not the territorial defence, because the army would be operational across the whole of Ukraine, not just Kyiv or another city. \u2018There is a joke in Ukraine that if the country asks you to join the military in peacetime, you are not able to because you are ill, but if there\u2019s a real fight we cannot accommodate all the requests to join the army, and it\u2019s true. \u2018A lot of people who don\u2019t have military training are applying to join the territorial defence because they don\u2019t want to see Russian flags flying over our heads.\u2019 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has invited foreign nationals to join the resistance to the Russian invasion (Picture: Ukraine Presidency/AFP via Getty) Territorial defence fighters receive weapons and ammunition in Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv (Picture: EPA/Mikhail Palinchak) Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to the UK, told the BBC yesterday that the embassy had become a focal point for an outpouring of support. Mr Prystaiko said: \u2018We have an overwhelming number of people coming and bombarding us, staying in front of the embassy and requiring, demanding to allow them. \u2018We don\u2019t want to break any laws, especially international laws, but most of those people who are coming are Ukrainians, they have the right to come home at any moment and fight. It\u2019s not just Ukrainians, it\u2019s everybody, from all the nations, they are just asking how we can get in.\u2019 One sixty-year-old British man outside the embassy told Sky today that he used to be in the Territorial Army and \u2018I can get on a flight tomorrow\u2019. He spoke after President Zelenskiyy issued a call for \u2018friends of peace and democracy\u2019 to join an international legion. He said: \u2018Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.\u2019 A Ukrainian soldier stands guard in Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square (Picture: EPA/Zurab Kurtsikidze) Sixty British volunteers were said by MailOnline to be heading to Ukraine to join the Georgian National Legion, which accepts foreign fighters. On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expressed her support for those wanting to join the Ukrainian fight against Russia. However, Mr Wallace told Sky News: \u2018Unless you are properly trained, unless you are an experienced member of the armed forces, there are better ways for you to contribute to the security of Ukraine.\u2019 Downing Street also steered cleared of Ms Truss\u2019s sentiment. The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u2018We think the best way we can help Ukraine right now is by ensuring Putin fails. \u2018There are a number of ways that Brits can show their support, and the Ukrainian embassy in London is putting out information about how British people can support them. \u2018We fully recognise the strength of feeling about British people wanting to support the Ukrainians following the Russian invasion. There\u2019s advice up on travelling to Ukraine, we currently advise against travel to Ukraine.\u2019 Do you have a story you would like to share?

        "content": "African students claim border guards operated a \u2018white Ukrainians first\u2019 policy (Picture: AFP) Young Africans studying in Ukraine say they have suffered racism at the Polish border, where some 500,000 refugees fleeing the invasion have crossed. Several videos posted on social media appeared to show tense confrontations with border guards in which crowds of predominantly Black people were shouted at or obstructed. In one clip, men in hi-vis jackets could be seen standing in formation next to white vans blocking the road, refusing to let anyone pass. Some raised both hands to show they are not carrying weapons, shouting \u2018We are students! We are not armed!\u2019, before the crowd burst through the barricade and ran towards the border. The user who posted the clip, a man of Nigerian origin, wrote: \u2018Their Police and Army refused to let Africans cross they only allow Ukrainian. \u2018Some have slept here for 2 days under this scorching cold weather, while many have gone back to Lviv.\u2019 A large number of refugees of African, Middle Eastern and Asian origin have successfully made it into Poland, although fears have grown of an impending humanitarian crisis with limited shelter and supplies at checkpoints. Many Africans remain stranded in Ukraine, according to two Londoners, Tokunbo Koiki and Patricia Daley, who have raised \u00a320,043 online in less than two days with the help of a medical student in Ukraine named Koko.

Citing conversations with fleeing students, Ms Koiki told ITV News: \u2018There\u2019s a segregation that\u2019s happening at the borders. \u2018White Ukrainians have been allowed in with open arms, and blankets.\u201d \u2018This is the anti-blackness that is global. So even within a war, even within being under siege, we still have racism.\u2019 Many refugees from Africa, the Middle East and India are students at Ukrainian universities (Picture: AFP) The money is going towards travel and accommodation, while the organisers are also helping the students find others in similar situations and map routes out of the country. Ms Koiki added: \u2018People are scared. People are really, really terrified. Especially for the people in the major cities who are currently under attack. \u2018We\u2019ve had students who simply couldn\u2019t afford a bus, we\u2019ve been able to send them funds and they\u2019ve been able to split the cost to make it easier, and really create a sense of community.\u2019 Ms Daley said a number of people in Poland had contacted her to offer transport and shelter to stranded students, but said her \u2018overwhelming conclusion\u2019 was to despair at the racism they had suffered.

The two countries have been in conflict since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a special military operation last week. On Saturday, Chelsea announced that Abramovich was handing over \"stewardship and care\" of\u00a0the London club to its\u00a0foundation's trustees. As stated by Abramovich's spokesperson on Monday, as part of a report\u00a0by Jewish News\u00a0and later confirmed elsewhere,\u00a0the 55-year-old has been\u00a0\"contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution\"\u00a0which he has been trying to help reach \"ever since.\" \"Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement\" the spokesperson added.

Executive director Marina Granovskaia, manager Thomas Tuchel, and technical advisor Petr Cech will continue to make transfer decisions within the club's budget and Financial Far Play rules. However, the Chelsea Foundation's trustees have reportedly yet to fully agree to take over the club.\u00a0",

        "content": "Nikita Mazepin\u2019s future with the Haas F1 team is in doubt. (Photo by Mark Thompson/Getty Images) Ukraine\u2019s has requested that motorsport\u2019s governing body the FIA bans Russian drivers from taking part in races at all events it oversees, including Formula 1\u2019s Nikita Mazepin. The head of the Automobile Federation of Ukraine, Leonid Kostyuchenko, sent a letter to the FIA demanding that it strip all Russian drivers of their licence to participate in FIA organised events, alongside other sanction requests designed to render Russians pariahs in motorsport. The move comes after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine across land, sea, and air which has led to violent assaults on a variety of major Ukrainian cities including the capital Kyiv. Backed by NATO funds and weaponry, the Ukrainian army is withstanding the Russian pressure so far, and so-called peace talks are scheduled to take place on the Belarussian border today. Newly-elected FIA president Mohamed Ben Sulayem wrote to Kostyuchenko last week offering his \u201cfull support and the support of the FIA\u201d in the wake of the Russian attack, and moves by other sporting and cultural organisations to punish Russia for the actions of its president.

In response to Ben Sulayem\u2019s offer for support, Kostyuchenko sent a letter demanding the effective expulsion of all Russian drivers from top level organised competition, a ban on FIA-sanctioned events taking place in Russia, and the barring of the Russian flag or national anthem being used at races.

His father Dmitry, an oligarch who has was summoned for a one-to-one meeting with Putin while the invasion was beginning last Thursday, essentially paid for his son to race in F1 by using his fertiliser company Ural Kali\u2019s money to sponsor the American-owned Haas team. The team has run a Russian-flag inspired livery and Ural Kali branding since the beginning of the 2021 season, when the younger Mazepin joined as driver, but removed all Russian colours and Ural Kali logos from its car at testing in Barcelona last Friday after the assault on Ukraine began. Team principal Gunther Steiner admitted that the future of Mazepin, who is widely considered by far the worst driver on the Formula 1 grid and who endured an embarrassing rookie season in which he was plagued by spins, slow pace and an accusation of groping a woman in a video posted online, \u2018needs to be resolved.\u2019 Lewis Hamilton wants full FIA findings into Michael Masi controversy made public Lewis Hamilton had F1 title \u2018completely taken away\u2019 by decision F1 agrees was \u2018incorrect\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page.

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) \u2014 Drivers in Tampa Bay are feeling the impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine at the gas pump. \"It's going up everyday,\" Cleveeland Russ told 8 On Your Side. \"I mean, at this rate, shoot, I'm going to be parking this truck.\" According to AAA, Floridians are currently paying an average of $3.53 for a gallon of gas. The price is better than the national average of $3.60. Gas prices in the Sunshine State are up 4 cents since last week, and 33 cents since the start of 2022. \"I mean, with rates that are going up and everything else that's going up, it's hard to survive out here,\" Russ said. \"Everything is going up, it's crazy, everything but your pay rate at work.\" Experts with AAA say prices could surge 15 to 30 cents in the coming weeks and months depending on oil prices. \"It's just a very volatile market right now and then, when you introduce a situation like this with Russia and Ukraine, it just adds to the volatility. It adds to the concern in the marker which is ultimately driving prices higher,\" AAA spokesman Mark Jenkins explained. Jenkins said the high demand for gas has played a role in increasing costs. Increased demand during the busy spring and summer travel seasons could further drive up prices, according to AAA. Russ says he's considering driving less. \"I haven't before but, I'm starting to now. I'm starting to look at it that way now,\" he said. \"Hopefully they come down sometime soon, that way we can afford to be riding around here.\" AAA suggests the following steps to save on gasoline: Combine errands to limit driving time.Shop around for the best gas prices in your community.\u00a0Consider paying cash. Some retailers charge extra per gallon for customers who\u00a0pay with a credit card.Remove excess weight in your vehicle.\u00a0Drive conservatively. Aggressive acceleration\u00a0and speeding reduces fuel economy. You can find daily updates to Florida gas price averages here.",

        "description": "Outgunned but determined Ukrainian troops slowed Russia\u2019s advance and held onto the capital and other key cities \u2014 at least for now.",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Outgunned but determined Ukrainian troops\u00a0slowed Russia\u2019s advance\u00a0and held onto the capital and other key cities \u2014 at least for now. In the face of stiff resistance and devastating sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia\u2019s nuclear forces put on high alert, threatening to elevate the war to a terrifying new level. Explosions and gunfire that have disrupted life\u00a0since the invasion began last week\u00a0appeared to subside around Kyiv overnight, as Ukrainian and Russian delegations met Monday on Ukraine\u2019s border with Belarus. It's unclear what, if anything, those talks would yield. Terrified Ukrainian families huddled in shelters, basements or corridors, waiting to find out. Exact death tolls are unclear, but the U.N. human rights chief said 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded \u2014 warning that figure was likely a vast undercount \u2014 and Ukraine\u2019s president said at least 16 children were among the dead. More than 500,000 people\u00a0have fled the country\u00a0since the invasion, another U.N. official said Monday \u2014 among the millions who have left their homes. Russia's Central Bank\u00a0scrambled to shore up\u00a0the tanking ruble Monday and the U.S. and European countries\u00a0upped weapons shipments\u00a0to Ukraine. While they hope to curb Putin\u2019s aggression after he unleashed Europe's biggest conflict since World War II, the measures also risked pushing an increasingly\u00a0cornered Putin\u00a0closer to the edge. \u201cI sit and pray for these negotiations to end successfully, so that they reach an agreement to end the slaughter, and so there is no more war,\" said Alexandra Mikhailova, weeping as she clutched her cat in a makeshift shelter in the strategic southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Around her, parents sought to console children and keep them warm. The following map shows the locations of known Russian military strikes and ground attacks inside Ukraine after Russia announced a military invasion of Ukraine. The information in this map is current as of February 27, 2022 at 5 p.m. eastern time In Kyiv, long lines formed outside supermarkets on Monday as residents were allowed out of bomb shelters and homes for the first time since a curfew imposed Saturday. The relative lull in warfare Monday morning in Ukraine\u00a0was unlikely to last. Neighboring Belarus could send troops to help Russia as soon as Monday, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts. The British Defense Ministry said Monday that the bulk of Putin\u2019s forces are about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces. Western nations ramped up the pressure with a freeze on Russia\u2019s hard currency reserves, threatening to bring Russia\u2019s economy to its knees. Russians withdrew savings and sought to shed rubles for dollars and euros, while Russian businesses scrambled to protect their finances. In addition to sanctions, the U.S. and Germany announced they will send Stinger missiles to Ukraine among other military supplies. The European Union \u2014 founded to ensure peace on the continent after World War II \u2014 is supplying lethal aid for the first time, including anti-tank weapons and ammunition. At least one Western country is studying a request from Ukraine to provide fighter jets, a European official said. She spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not yet public. EU defense ministers were to meet Monday to discuss how to get the pledged weaponry into Ukraine. Germany\u2019s defense minister said without elaborating that her country has \u201cchannels and possibilities\u201d to do that, and a trainload of Czech equipment arrived Sunday. Blocking off those shipments will clearly be a key Russian priority. window.loadAnvato({\"mcp\":\"LIN\",\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":\"100%\",\"video\":\"7482369\",\"autoplay\":false,\"expect_preroll\":true,\"pInstance\":\"p1\",\"plugins\":{\"comscore\":{\"clientId\":\"6036439\",\"c3\":\"kron4.com\",\"script\":\"//w3.mp.lura.live/player/prod/v3/plugins/comscore/comscoreplugin.min.js\",\"useDerivedMetadata\":true,\"mapping\":{\"video\":{\"c3\":\"kron4.com\",\"ns_st_st\":\"kron\",\"ns_st_pu\":\"Nexstar\",\"ns_st_ge\":\"News\",\"cs_ucfr\":\"\"},\"ad\":{\"c3\":\"kron4.com\",\"ns_st_st\":\"kron\",\"ns_st_pu\":\"Nexstar\",\"ns_st_ge\":\"News\",\"cs_ucfr\":\"\"}}},\"dfp\":{\"adTagUrl\":\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=1x1000&iu=/5678/mg.kron&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vmap&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&description_url=https://www.kron4.com/feed/&cust_params=vid%3D7482369%26pers_cid%3Dunknown%26bob_ck%3D[bob_ck_val]%26d_code%3D1%26pagetype%3Dnone\"},\"nielsen\":{\"apid\":\"P4D4F9915-E46E-4B58-BCA6-DE3D1F253081\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"type\":\"dcr\",\"apn\":\"Anvato\",\"environment\":\"production\",\"useDerivedMetadata\":true,\"mapping\":{\"adloadtype\":2,\"adModel\":2}},\"segmentCustom\":{\"script\":\"https://segment.psg.nexstardigital.net/anvato.js\",\"writeKey\":\"QGNqOmmYpir0f5DXkZwgZa8l2xvaSIjJ\",\"pluginsLoadingTimeout\":12}},\"expectPrerollTimeout\":8,\"accessKey\":\"EZmrR4Ev5xYnMfdbY5TPc7naKmy32MKp\",\"token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2aWQiOiI3NDgyMzY5IiwiaXNzIjoiRVptclI0RXY1eFluTWZkYlk1VFBjN25hS215MzJNS3AiLCJleHAiOjE2NDYwNTc2NTd9.W4g5BPECzKOxHxT3Int3DLhER6bgftHYzA58Kc3kiNk\",\"nxs\":{\"mp4Url\":\"https://tkx.mp.lura.live/rest/v2/mcp/video/7482369?anvack=jpaEL4lxR2eBmIoPzBsGeTzePv0492Dx&token=%7E6Syxc5ABZES5MC5SZVqnVbloGseZvo70MQ%3D%3D\",\"enableFloatingPlayer\":true},\"disableMutedAutoplay\":false,\"recommendations\":false,\"expectPreroll\":true,\"titleVisible\":true,\"pauseOnClick\":true,\"trackTimePeriod\":60}); It remains to be seen how much the weaponry will help Ukraine fend off Russia\u2019s vastly greater arsenal. The increasingly erratic Putin made a clear link between ever-tightening sanctions and his decision Sunday to raise Russia\u2019s nuclear posture. He also pointed at \u201caggressive statements\u201d by NATO as a reason for his move, a reference to his long-running stance that the U.S.-led alliance is an existential threat to Russia. U.S. and British officials played down Putin\u2019s nuclear threat, and its practical meaning was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces that are prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not. A tiny sliver of hope emerged as talks began between Ukrainian and Russian officials Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said it would demand an immediate cease-fire. While Ukraine sent its defense minister and other top officials, the Russian delegation is led by Putin's adviser on culture \u2014 an unlikely envoy for ending the war and a sign of how Moscow views the talks. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what Putin is seeking in the talks or from the war itself. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government and replace it with a regime of his own, reviving Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence. His comments Sunday raised fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake. Photos: Thousands flee Ukraine amid Russian conflict In New York, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly\u00a0scheduled an emergency session Monday\u00a0on Russia\u2019s invasion. With the Ukrainian capital besieged, the Russian military offered to allow residents to leave Kyiv via a safe corridor, raising fears a further onslaught is coming. The\u00a0mayor of the city of nearly 3 million\u00a0had earlier expressed doubt that civilians could be evacuated. Authorities have been handing out weapons to anyone willing to defend the city. Ukraine is also releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight, and training people to make firebombs. Battles also broke out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and strategic ports in the country's south came under assault from Russian forces. Mariupol, a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov, is \u201changing on,\u201d said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. The Russian military claimed Monday it had taken full control of Ukraine\u2019s airspace after showering its air bases and air defense batteries with air and missile strikes. But a similar claim on the first day of the invasion turned out to be untrue, and U.S. officials said Sunday that Moscow has failed to fully control Ukrainian skies. \u2018Invaders will die\u2019: Former Miss Grand Ukraine joins fight against Russian forces In Mariupol, where Ukrainians were trying to fend off attack, a medical team at a city hospital desperately tried to revive a 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajamas who was mortally wounded in Russian shelling. During the rescue attempt, a doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into the girl, looked directly into the Associated Press video camera capturing the scene. \u201cShow this to Putin,\"\u00a0he said angrily. \u201cThe eyes of this child, and crying doctors.\" Their resuscitation efforts failed, and the girl lay dead on a gurney, covered by her blood-splattered jacket. Nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) away, Faina Bystritska was under threat in the city of Chernihiv. \u201cI wish I had never lived to see this,\u201d said Bystritska, an 87-year-old Jewish survivor of World War II. She said sirens blare almost constantly in the city, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from Kyiv. Among Western sanctions is a freeze on Russia's hard currency reserves, which Putin had built up in recent years to increase the country's economic independence. The unprecedented move could have devastating consequences for the country's financial system. The U.S., European Union and Britain also agreed to block selected Russian banks from the SWIFT system, which facilitates moving money around thousands of banks and other financial institutions worldwide.",

        "content": "War-hit Ukraine is the third most popular destination after China and the Philippines for Indian students pursuing medical studies. Every year, thousands of Indian students choose Ukraine for many reasons. As per available data, around 18,000 Indian students are stranded in Ukraine which has been attacked by Russia with full military might. The majority of the stranded students are pursuing medical courses. Around 1,000 students have been evacuated so far from the conflict-ridden nation. Shakshi Yadav, whose younger brother and sister \u2013 Mandeep Yadav and Mahima Yadav \u2013 are studying medicine at the Lviv State Medical Institute in Ukraine, told IANS that fees are near to half in Ukraine as compared to India. She said that apart from lower fees, better infrastructure and different patterns of study attract students from India. \"There is also a paucity of medical seats in India. We pay around Rs 10 lakh annually for each of them to pursue study in Ukraine,\" Shakshi said. Shirish Mehta, who did his MBBS from Ukraine, said that the infrastructure in medical colleges in Ukraine is far better than in India, while the cost of medical education in Ukraine is half compared to private colleges in India. \"If we talk about government medical colleges, annual cost of courses like MBBS is around Rs 3 lakh. On the other hand, in Indian private medical colleges, the cost rises to around Rs 20 lakh annually,\" he added. Educationist CS Kandpal said that one of the major reasons for the popularity of medical courses in Ukraine is that students do not have to take any separate examination to join them, whereas NEET is conducted in India for admission to medical courses. While lakhs of students appear in NEET every year, only about 40,000 get admission to government medical colleges. In such a situation, a large number of NEET qualified Indian students turn to Ukraine, he added.",

(Photo by James Chance/Getty Images) Former Russian boxer Alexander Povetkin has appeared to defend his country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in a post on social media which parrots president Vladimir Putin\u2019s rhetoric about \u2018fighting back Nazism.\u2019 The 42-year-old has gone against the grain of a slew of Russian stars and celebrities \u2014 including the likes of tennis players Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev \u2014 who have made public declarations in favour of peace over war, by seemingly attempting to justify the violent assault Russia launched on Ukraine last week. Russia has attacked a majority of Ukraine\u2019s major cities which shelling, ground troops and air units, after an invasion over land, sea and air began in the early hours of Thursday. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled since the invasion began, while some of those who have remained have been given weaponry by the government in order to defend themselves and their nation.

        "content": "Russian millionaires should not enjoy prosperity brought by democracy and peace, Spanish FM says The Spanish Foreign Minister has proposed closing European ports to Russian ships as part of sanctions punishing Moscow for its attack on Ukraine. This would make \u201cRussian oligarchs\u201d pay their share of the prices of Russian foreign policy, Jose Manuel Albares told Radio Nacional de Espana on Monday.\u00a0 The minister was explaining the EU\u2019s use of individual sanctions against Russian citizens. The minister said he proposed to his EU counterparts \u201cto close the ports of Europe to those yachts of millionaire oligarchs\u201d from Russia. The measure will prevent them from enjoying \u201cthe stability and prosperity that freedom, democracy and peace bring, which are the pillars with which we have built the European Union,\u201d Albares explained. The remark came as a commentary to a story that was widely reported over in the European press on Sunday. The story was about a Ukrainian mechanic, who allegedly tried to sabotage the boat of his employer of ten years that was docked in Mallorca. Read more EU closes skies to Russian aircraft The suspect reportedly said after being arrested that his boss was a senior Russian state-owned company official involved in weapons manufacturing and thus \u201ca criminal who makes money selling weapons that now kill Ukrainians.\u201d The sabotage was an act of revenge, he told a judge, according to the Spanish media. Many EU nations, and later the union itself, have already closed their airspace to Russian passenger planes as part of their response to the hostilities in Ukraine. Moscow has been responding to those measures in kind. Russia launched its attack on Ukraine on Thursday, claiming it was necessary to stop violence by Ukrainian troops against separatist Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which Moscow recognized as independent states earlier in the week. Kiev and its Western backers say the attack is an illegal war of aggression and that Russia wants to occupy Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s stated its goals as demilitarization of the country and eradication of neo-Nazi forces entrenched in its military and law enforcement.",

        "content": "Several European countries promised to supply Kiev with weapons during Russia\u2019s military operation The UK said on Monday that it has successfully supplied weapons to Ukraine after Russia launched its military operation against its neighbor. Sky News asked Defense Secretary Ben Wallace if London managed to deliver any weapons to Ukraine after the start of the Russian attack on early Thursday morning. Wallace replied: \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got lethal and non-lethal aid into Ukraine.\u201d He refused to reveal the details because it \u201cwould put people at risk.\u201d \u201cBritain was the first European country to step up to join America with lethal aid,\u201d Wallace said. The UK supplied Ukraine with portable anti-tank missile launchers earlier this year and was training Ukrainian soldiers until London pulled its instructors from the country in February amid the rising tensions with Moscow.

Ukraine said the hostilities were completely unprovoked and appealed to the international community for help. Many countries, including the US, and EU member states, pledged their support for Ukraine and imposed new sanctions on Russia, hitting its banks and trade, among other restrictions. Germany and the Netherlands promised to send anti-tank weapons and Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Kiev, while Belgium said it will deliver machine guns and fuel. After several delays, Russia and Ukraine are holding peace talks in Belarus on Monday.",

Anonymous is an international group of activist hackers (known as \u2018hacktivists\u2019) primarily known for its various\u00a0cyberattacks\u00a0against several governments, institutions, and big businesses. The Anonymous mask is based on Guy Fawkes (Picture: Pictures Ltd./Corbis via Getty Images) Although the exact origin is unknown, it is believed to have started in 2003 on the\u00a0imageboard\u00a04chan, with users of the site coming together after becoming increasingly disgruntled with modern politics. In its early form, the concept of Anonymous was adopted by a decentralised\u00a0online community\u00a0aiming coordinated virtual attacks toward various loosely-agreed targets, primarily for the sake of entertainment. The slowly group gained momentum, and in 2008, they launched a series of\u00a0protests, pranks, and\u00a0hacks\u00a0targeting the Church of Scientology \u2013 known as Project Chanology. Over time, Anonymous has grown, taking on larger targets such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, Sony, as well as government agencies of the United States, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda \u2013 and now Russia.

        "content": "Outgunned but determined Ukrainian troops slowed Russia\u2019s advance and held onto the capital and other key cities \u2014 at least for now. In the face of stiff resistance and devastating sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia\u2019s nuclear forces put on high alert, threatening to elevate the war to a terrifying new level. Explosions and gunfire that have disrupted life since the invasion began last week appeared to subside around Kyiv overnight, as Ukrainian and Russian delegations prepared to meet Monday on Ukraine\u2019s border with Belarus. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, those talks would yield. Terrified Ukrainian families huddled in shelters, basements or corridors, waiting to find out. Exact death tolls are unclear, but Ukraine\u2019s president says at least 16 children have been killed and another 45 wounded, among hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other casualties. Millions have fled homes or the country all together. Russia\u2019s Central Bank scrambled to shore up the tanking ruble Monday and the U.S. and European countries upped weapons shipments to Ukraine. While they hope to curb Putin\u2019s aggression after he unleashed Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II, the measures also risked pushing an increasingly cornered Putin closer to the edge. \u201cI sit and pray for these negotiations to end successfully, so that they reach an agreement to end the slaughter, and so there is no more war,\u201d said Alexandra Mikhailova, weeping as she clutched her cat in a makeshift shelter in the strategic southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Around her, parents sought to console children and keep them warm. Read more: Transport Canada launching review after it says Russian flight used banned Canadian airspace Demonstrators march in Toronto to show support for Ukraine Canada sending $25-million worth of additional military equipment to Ukraine The relative lull in warfare Monday morning in Ukraine was unlikely to last. Neighboring Belarus could send troops to help Russia as soon as Monday, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts. The British Defense Ministry said Monday that the bulk of Putin\u2019s forces are about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces. Western nations ramped up the pressure with a freeze on Russia\u2019s hard currency reserves, threatening to bring Russia\u2019s economy to its knees. Russians withdrew savings and sought to shed rubles for dollars and euros, while Russian businesses scrambled to protect their finances. In addition to sanctions, the U.S. and Germany announced they will send Stinger missiles to Ukraine among other military supplies. The European Union \u2014 founded to ensure peace on the continent after World War II \u2014 is supplying lethal aid for the first time, including fighter jets. EU defense ministers were to meet Monday to discuss how to get the pledged weaponry into Ukraine. Germany\u2019s defense minister said without elaborating that her country has \u201cchannels and possibilities\u201d to do that, and a trainload of Czech equipment arrived Sunday. Blocking off those shipments will clearly be a key Russian priority. It remains to be seen how much the weaponry will help Ukraine fend off Russia\u2019s vastly greater arsenal. The increasingly erratic Putin made a clear link between ever-tightening sanctions and his decision Sunday to raise Russia\u2019s nuclear posture. He also pointed at \u201caggressive statements\u201d by NATO as a reason for his move, a reference to his long-running stance that the U.S.-led alliance is an existential threat to Russia. U.S. and British officials played down Putin\u2019s nuclear threat, and its practical meaning was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces that are prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not. A tiny sliver of hope emerged as a Ukrainian delegation arrived on the border with Belarus for talks with Russian officials Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said it would demand an immediate cease-fire. While Ukraine sent its defense minister and other top officials, the Russian delegation is led by Putin\u2019s adviser on culture \u2014 an unlikely envoy for ending the war and a sign of how Moscow views the talks. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what Putin is seeking in the talks or from the war itself. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government and replace it with a regime of his own, reviving Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence. His comments Sunday raised fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake. In New York, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly scheduled an emergency session Monday on Russia\u2019s invasion. With the Ukrainian capital besieged, the Russian military offered to allow residents to leave Kyiv via a safe corridor, raising fears a further onslaught is coming. The mayor of the city of nearly 3 million had earlier expressed doubt that civilians could be evacuated. Authorities have been handing out weapons to anyone willing to defend the city. Ukraine is also releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight, and training people to make firebombs. Battles also broke out in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and strategic ports in the country\u2019s south came under assault from Russian forces. Mariupol, a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov, is \u201changing on,\u201d said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. The Russian military claimed Monday it had taken full control of Ukraine\u2019s airspace after showering its air bases and air defense batteries with air and missile strikes. But a similar claim on the first day of the invasion turned out to be untrue, and U.S. officials said Sunday that Moscow has failed to fully control Ukrainian skies. In Mariupol, where Ukrainians were trying to fend off attack, a medical team at a city hospital desperately tried to revive a 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajamas who was mortally wounded in Russian shelling. During the rescue attempt, a doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into the girl, looked directly into the Associated Press video camera capturing the scene. \u201cShow this to Putin,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cThe eyes of this child, and crying doctors.\u201d Their resuscitation efforts failed, and the girl lay dead on a gurney, covered by her blood-splattered jacket. Nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) away, Faina Bystritska was under threat in the city of Chernihiv. \u201cI wish I had never lived to see this,\u201d said Bystritska, an 87-year-old Jewish survivor of World War II. She said sirens blare almost constantly in the city, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from Kyiv. Among Western sanctions is a freeze on Russia\u2019s hard currency reserves, which Putin had built up in recent years to increase the country\u2019s economic independence. The unprecedented move could have devastating consequences for the country\u2019s financial system. The U.S., European Union and Britain also agreed to block selected Russian banks from the SWIFT system, which facilitates moving money around thousands of banks and other financial institutions worldwide.",

I am certain that would be just. I am certain we deserve it. I am certain that can be done. Ukraine set EU and NATO membership as foreign policy goals in its constitution. Before the current crisis, Brussels repeatedly told Kiev that it was not ready to join, and demanded that the government implement numerous reforms. Kiev complained that pressure from Russia left it with no resources to meet those demands and wanted to receive a definitive deadline for membership in both organizations. Russia attacked Ukraine last Thursday, citing the need to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Ukraine now, before an armed conflict would be unleashed on its territory. Kiev accused Moscow of \u201cunprovoked\u201d aggression.",

Moscow launched a full scale military attack, last week, and its troops are positioned on the outskirts of the capital, Kiev. On Monday, footage purported to show two Ukrainian helicopters arriving in the Gomel region, close to the border. The office of the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev\u2019s delegation includes the Minister of Defense, Alexey Reznikov, the head of the ruling Servant of the People faction, David Arakhamia, and the deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay Tochitskiy, as well as others. According to the statement, Kiev\u2019s main goal in the crunch talks with Moscow is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow did not announce its position ahead of the talks with Kiev\u2019s representatives because the discussions \u201cshould go on in silence.\u201d He also expressed regret that the high-stakes negotiations did not start a day earlier, insisting that there was an opportunity.\u00a0 The Ukrainian side agreed to hold talks with their Russian colleagues on Sunday after initially refusing to send a team of representatives over disagreements on location and preliminary terms. Kiev argued that it was inappropriate to hold crisis discussions in Belarus, claiming that Moscow\u2019s armed forces were using the territory to carry out attacks. Minsk, however, has insisted that its troops are not facilitating in the military operation.

        "content": "Strictly\u2019s Shirley Ballas took issue with James Jordan\u2019s impassioned tweet calling out some of his former Russian co-stars (Picture: Rex) Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has called out former professional James Jordan after the dancer urged Russian stars of the BBC series to speak out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Sunday, James slammed some of his former co-stars for not using their platform to pledge their allegiance to the Ukrainian people, choosing to use social media to \u2018promote\u2019 themselves\u2019 instead. \u2018I don\u2019t see many of the Russian dancers I know and have even shared the Strictly dance floor with them openly speaking out about the war against Ukraine,\u2019 he vented. \u2018But are still promoting themselves on social media \u2013 very disappointed. They know who they are \u2013 not one post about it.\u2019 In another tweet, he wrote: \u2018If they are too scared to speak out against wrong then stay the f**k off social media for a while and stop with the self-promotion during this horrific time. \u2018Have some respect. Or\u2026 maybe they are not speaking out because they are brainwashed too.\u2019 Taking issue with Jordan\u2019s impassioned post, Ballas claimed she knew plenty of Russian dancers speaking up against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Shirley Ballas took issue with James\u2019 post (Picture: Twitter) \u2018Dear James, not sure who you follow and who follows you,\u2019 she replied. \u2018Many dancers I know have retweeted in support of Ukraine and have felt shame at their own government. \u2018Lots of help for their fellow dancers Lots have spoken out and retweeted.\u2019 Jordan eventually shared Ballas\u2019 recent post urging dancers to come forward and \u2018show some sensitivity towards the suffering Ukraine\u2019, also calling anyone out for taking this time to \u2018promote yourselves, your shows, competitions, and teaching every single day\u2019. \u2018Why post this yesterday then?\u2019 Jordan hit back. \u2018A similar sentiment to me.\u2019 \u2018Why post this yesterday then?\u2019 (Picture: Twitter) Former Strictly pro Kristina Rihanoff has been forced to apologise after fans thought she appeared to be backing Putin. The Russian-born dancer criticised world leaders, including Prime Minister\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0and US President Joe Biden, and their various scandals in comparison to Mr Putin, who has led the invasion against Ukraine.\u00a0 She also called out Sky News for reporting on Eurovision banning Russia from taking part in the upcoming song contest.\u00a0 However, she has since stressed: \u2018The dancer then stated: \u2018I\u2019m not supporting Putin, war, invasion, lost lives and politics. I hate it as much as a human being possibly can. If I offended anyone it wasn\u2019t my intention and I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u2019 Russia-Ukraine war: Everything you need to know Fierce fighting has broken out in Kyiv as Russian forces descend on Ukraine's capital city.

Kiev\u2019s delegation on Monday arrived at the Ukraine-Belarus border to take part in the negotiations with the Russian delegation. The Ukrainian delegation\u00a0came in two helicopters, as reported by the Russian agency Ria Novosti.

READ MORE: Russian-Ukrainian peace talks to begin on Monday The Russian delegation, headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin and former culture minister, arrived in Gomel, eastern Belarus, on Saturday. Ukrainian officials initially refused to send a delegation to Belarus, arguing that it was inappropriate to hold talks in the country since Russian troops were using its territory to stage attacks. Minsk denied that its forces were participating in the Russian operation. After a phone call between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus on Saturday, Kiev agreed to the talks. However, the arrival of the Ukrainian team was further delayed due to logistical issues.",

        "content": "New Delhi: Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Belarus is preparing to join in on Russia's invasion of Ukraine as soon as Monday.According to reports, the President of Belarus has issued a World War III warning and Russian troops are using the Belarus's soil for attacking Ukraine using their tanks and weapons which are already stationed in Belarus. Interestingly, Belarus has amended its constitution to allow for the deployment of 'nuclear weapons' in its country. As per the official report released by the Ukrainian State Security Service, it has been revealed that a rocket attack on Ukraine's Zhytomyr airport has been carried out from Belarus, which is just 93 miles from the capital Kyiv.At the same time, several reports quoted military sources as saying that Belarusian Special Forces were seen loading ammunition on airplanes to prepare for air strikes on Kyiv and there is now a fear that the war may extend.Ukrainian intelligence agencies have reportedly learned that from Belarus soldiers have been seen preparing planes for a major attack. \"It is very clear [Belarus' capital] Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin,\" a US official told the Washington Post, speaking on condition of anonymity.The US official, however, did not give any indication of how many soldiers were missing and where they would be deployed. Indeed, the Russian military has faced strong resistance from the defenders of Ukraine, and US officials say that the attack is not succeeding as Russia had planned, so it is now time to turn the war in its favour. Following this, Russia can change its strategy.Notably, there is a very close friendship between Belarus and Russia and both the countries share. The president of the both countries have a very close friendship and it is believed that Belarus always follows Russia orders and in this war also Belarus allowed Russian troops to attack Ukraine from their country.Meanwhile, there is also a possibility that, if Belarus engages its soldiers in the war, then the third world war looks inevitable.Also read: Putin Forgot A Great WWII Lesson, The Best Soviet Soldiers Were UkrainianAlso watch:",

It was in service for over 30 years before reportedly being destroyed by Russian forces in Ukraine. Its compartment, which measures 43 meters by 6.4 meters by 4.4 meters, was large enough for 50 cars.

Designed by Kyiv-based Antonov in the 1980s, it first took flight in 1988. It was constructed to transport the Soviet space shuttle Buran, per Belgian industry website Aviation24. Only one copy of the plane has ever been produced.Plans to construct a modernized version of the plane were devised in the 1980s and abandoned two decades later, per UK aviation website Air Charter Service.The aircraft was in use for international cargo charter flights and operated by Antonov Airlines until its destruction, per The Aviationist.The plane's design dwarfs most other aircraft, measuring around 84 meters (275 feet) long, per Eurocontrol-run aviation website SKYbrary.This picture shows the wing and three of the six turbofans of the Ukrainian Antonov An-225 Mriya coming from China to deliver 8,6 million face masks and 150 tons of sanitary equipment ordered by a private customer, at the Paris-Vatry airport in Bussy Lettree, on April 19, 2020, on the 34th day of a strict lockdown in France to stop the spread of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus).Francois Nascimbeni/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plane is big enough the carry twice the cargo of a Boeing 747 freighter, per aviation website Air Charter Service.Its six ZMKB Progress Lotarev D-18T turbofan jet engines (pictured above) enabled the plane to cruise at a maximum speed of around 849 kilometers per hour (528 miles per hour), the site reported.The plane could accommodate up to 250 tonnes of cargo, the weight of roughly 247 Toyota Corolla cars.A Bundeswehr soldier unloads from an Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo airplane boxes with protective masks delivered from China on April 27, 2020 at the airport of Leipzig in eastern Germany.RONNY HARTMANN/AFP Ronny Hartmann/AFP/Getty ImagesThe nose of the plane (pictured above) allows cargo to be loaded from the front. In contrast, many other cargo planes are loaded from the plug doors on their sides.While the plane was capable of carrying tanks and wind turbine blades, it also sent humanitarian aid around the world.\u00a0The plane transported relief goods in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and medical equipment in early 2020 to help with the fight against COVID-19, per CNN.The plane weighed about 330 tonnes, according to automotive news website Autoevolution.Ukrainian Antonov An-225 \"Mriya\" aircraft is seen in the assembly shop of the Antonov aircraft plant in Kiev, Ukraine on September 07, 2016.Vladimir Shtanko/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBecause of its weight, the plane had 32 wheels.The design of the aircraft was derived from the An-124 Ruslan, another Antonov-constructed plane,\u00a0industry website Aerospace Technology reported.Its compartment, which measures 43 meters by 6.4 meters by 4.4 meters (pictured below), was big enough to hold 50 cars, according to Aerotime Hub.Ukrainian Antonov An-225 \"Mriya\" aircraft is seen in the assembly shop of the Antonov aircraft plant in Kiev, Ukraine on September 07, 2016.Vladimir Shtanko/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe industry website\u00a0estimates that the plane has set more than 200 world records. These include airlifting the world's heaviest cargo, as well as transporting by air the world's longest cargo, the website reported.While the plane's parts were historically produced in Kyiv, production moved to China in 2016, per Aviation International News. At the time the plane was dormant and unused, and the Chinese takeover to complete the then-unfinished airframe reportedly cost $300 million, the industry news site reported.\u00a0When it was still in service, the plane could be chartered for around $30,000 an hour, according to the BBC.Crew members in protective suits stand inside an Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo airplane during a delivery of protective masks from China on April 27, 2020 at the airport of Leipzig, eastern Germany.Ronny Hartmann/AFP/Getty ImagesIf the aircraft were to be rebuilt, it take over five years and would cost $3 billion, Ukrainian state defense company Ukroboronprom said in a statement on February 27.\u00a0The statement also said the plane was under repair when Russia invaded the country on February 25, and therefore could not leave Ukraine.\u00a0\"Our task is to ensure that these costs are covered by the Russian Federation, which has caused intentional damage to Ukraine's aviation and air cargo sector,\" the statement said.Read the original article on Insider",

        "content": "War in Ukraine: How tech giants Meta, Google are 'fighting' the false informationWar in Ukraine: How tech giants Meta, Google are 'fighting' the false informationAs Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, another battle raged online and over the airwaves. Moscow stepped up efforts to control the narrative playing in the media and on tech platforms, while big tech companies Meta Platforms Inc, which owns Facebook, and Alphabet Inc's Google, imposed restrictions on the media controlled by the Russian state in Ukraine and across the world.On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook; Meta said it rejected a government request to stop independent verification of Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter said that its service was restricted to some Russian users. Pictures and videos took longer to load on Facebook after the slowdown was announced, as per users, while Facebook Messenger had long periods without loading. Twitter remained slow on mobile: It has been a punitive slowdown since March. Many state websites, including the Kremlin site kremlin.ru, have also been disrupted in recent days.For tech companies, the standoff is the latest step in an ongoing confrontation with Russia, where the platforms risk government-imposed restrictions on the country as it seeks to censor dissidents while protecting state media. Giant social, video and live streaming platforms, from Facebook to TikTok and Twitch, are under pressure to combat falsehoods on their platforms related to the conflict, including the spread of misleading images.The escalation of Russia's clash with big tech comes days before a deadline Moscow has set for major foreign tech companies to comply with a new law that requires them to establish official representation in the country, which could make it easier for the Kremlin to regulate platforms. It follows a series of fines and slowdowns imposed on platforms that the Russian government says failed to remove illegal content.Russia threatened companies with an advertising ban this month if they didn't comply. Tighter restrictions that could follow include speed reductions or outright lockdowns, Russian officials said.\"Mark Zuckerberg, while you create Metaverse \u2013 Russia ruins real life in Ukraine! We ask you to ban access to @facebookapp and @instagram from Russia \u2013 as long as tanks and missiles attack our kindergartens and hospitals!\" Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter on Sunday.RestrictionsRoskomnadzor warned local media not to circulate what it called \"false information\" about Moscow's military operation, banning the use of the words \"invasion\" and \"assault\" to describe its attack on Ukraine. Yandex, a Russian tech giant, has also started warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine in your search engine on unreliable information on the Internet.Russia calls its actions a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture people it sees as dangerous nationalists. The media has long been a contentious presence on major social platforms, some of which label those accounts in an effort to be more transparent about the source of information.Amid Russia's invasion, Facebook, Twitter, Google and its video streaming service YouTube have taken new steps to restrict Russian state media from making money from ads on their sites. Twitter, which banned ads from state-backed media in 2019, said it was pausing all ads in Russia and Ukraine to ensure visibility of public safety information. Google, the world's largest ad seller, also said it would not allow Russian state media to sell ads using its tools.Facebook and Google also said they had restricted access to some state media accounts in Ukraine at the request of the Ukrainian government. On Sunday Google said that it had banned downloads of RT's mobile app in Ukraine in response to a legal request from the government.With inputs from a syndicated feed",

In an open letter to President Vladimir Putin shared on social media on Sunday, the Crimean-born Karjakin said he fully backed the effort to fight \u201cfor the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cI appeal to you at this difficult time, when our country, led by you, is fighting for the safety of the peaceful Russian population of Donbass and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d wrote the 32-year-old. \u201cIt is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions. \u201cI am closely following the ongoing special operation, in the lands where I spent my childhood, where I learned to play chess and where my relatives still live. \"For eight long years we have been waiting with hope for salvation from countless shelling and loss of human lives, the ongoing genocide by the still acting Kiev regime. \u201cI express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace!

The global crypto community has also extended its support to Ukraine.

But we also know that rock and roll is forever and we feel confident there will be a time and a place for us to return in the future. Stay safe.\u2019\u00a0 The band, consisting of Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool, are due to kick off the tour with a North American leg on May 19 in Tampa, Florida. With the Russian date scrapped, it will then begin its European stint on June 1 in Berlin, Germany, with UK dates kicking off in London later that month.\u00a0 The American Idiot hitmakers announced the news in a statement on Sunday (Picture: @greenday, Instagram) The tour is set to conclude on September 24 at the Firefly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware.\u00a0 Several other artists have shows scheduled to take place in Russia this spring, including Bring Me The Horizon, OneRepublic, Saint Jhn, YungBlud and Khalid.\u00a0 Geoff Meall from London-based agent for Paradigm Agency, told Variety: \u2018We\u2019ve got [multiple] acts due to be going there from next month right through the summer \u2014 rock acts, alternative acts, a lot of electronic artists as well.\u00a0 More: US Showbiz newsResident Evil star Milla Jovovich devastated watching attack on birth place of UkraineSnoop Dogg reveals Queen Elizabeth helped stop him getting kicked out of UKKanye West 'not official with Kim Kardashian double Chaney Jones' after Julia Fox split \u2018As it stands, I can\u2019t see any of those shows being able to happen. Ukraine is an obviously an active war zone so it\u2019s impossible to do a concert there, and with Russia, first, every government is advising its citizens not to go there unless it\u2019s essential business \u2014 rock and roll probably wouldn\u2019t be considered that \u2014 but more, a lot of artists wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as supporting the actions of that government at the moment.\u2019 Last week, it was announced that Russia would not be allowed to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 following outrage from several countries about their involvement.

Two days prior, the embassy said Chinese citizens should show their national flag when driving. China continues to avoid outwardly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On Saturday, the Chinese embassy in Ukraine appealed to its citizens in the country to not highlight their identities in public.The recommendation comes two days after the embassy advised Chinese nationals to display their national flag when driving.In a WeChat post on Saturday, the embassy said that there's an uptick in \"extreme behavior\" in Ukraine that constitutes heightened security risks for Chinese citizens.\"Don't highlight your identity or display identifying symbols,\" the embassy recommended in the post, addressing Chinese nationals.China has sought to walk a fine line in its approach to the invasion, even as Russia, its close ally, comes under increasing pressure from the west.China repeatedly avoided calling Russia's actions an invasion at a press conference on Thursday organized by China's foreign ministry. On a call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday, Chinese president Xi Jinping urged Putin to resolve the situation through negotiations with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. In a statement on Sunday, Zelensky's office said Russian and Ukrainian delegations have agreed to meet for discussions on the Belarusian border.Chinese state-affiliated daily Global Times wrote in a report on Monday that at least one unnamed Chinese businesswoman based in Kyiv was harassed as China continued to pursue its current position on the conflict.\u00a0On Saturday, she was heckled by locals at a gas station, the report wrote. She was also quoted as saying that Chinese students in Ukraine have had to head to bomb shelters in groups to avoid being harassed on the way.\"Some agitated young Ukrainians must be thinking: China is on the side of Russia,\" the businesswoman was quoted as saying.Read the original article on Insider",

        "content": "New Delhi:\u00a0Russia said on Sunday that, after some back-and-forth, Ukraine agreed to dispatch a team to Belarus for talks to end the Russian military campaign in the country.Kiev \"confirmed\" the planned talks in Gomel Region, which is close to the borders of both Russia and Ukraine, Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky told reporters. Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin and former Culture Minister, added that the parties are now deciding on the logistics and the exact location of the summit, with \"maximum security\" for the Ukrainians, RT reported. \"We guarantee that the travel route will be 100 per cent safe. We will be waiting for the Ukrainian delegation,\" the Russian chief negotiator said. The Russian team arrived in Gomel on Sunday, where it said talks were planned with the Ukrainians. Kiev later said it wanted to negotiate on \"neutral ground\", arguing that Russian troops were using Belarusian territory to stage attacks on Ukraine. Minsk, however, denied that its forces were participating in the Russian operation, RT reported. The Russians initially said their team would stay in Belarus until 3 p.m. local time. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko over the phone, asking to move the deadline, according to Lukashenko's spokeswoman, Natalia Eismont, the report said. She said the Belarusian leader then spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who agreed to move the planned negotiations to a later time. Zelensky confirmed the call with Lukashenko on social media, but has not commented on the talks. Also read: 'Kiev Still Controlled By Ukrainian Army'Also watch:\u00a0",

It is unclear how many died -- but the number is likely to run into the hundreds, the report said. Among those said to have been wiped out was Chechen general Magomed Tushaev. He was commander of the 141th motorised national guard brigade -- Chechen head of state Ramzan Kadyrov's elite force, Daily Mail reported. Tushaev had also been pictured with Kadyrov, in a measure of his importance to the Chechen regime, which shot to notoriety in the west for hunting down, torturing and killing gay men, Daily Mail reported. Kadyrov is even believed to have visited his doomed squadron in a Ukrainian forest before their alleged deaths. The terror squadron's reported killings are a crushing psychological blow for Vladimir Putin's stalled efforts to conquer Ukraine. The Russian premiere had dispatched the group to capture or kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, knowing full well that the fighters' brutal reputation would strike further fear into the hearts of besieged Ukrainians, Daily Mail reported.Also read: China Uneasy To Defend Putin's MethodsAlso watch:\u00a0",

The professional dancer \u2013 who was born in Russia \u2013 criticised world leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, and their various scandals in comparison to Mr Putin, who has led the invasion against Ukraine. She also called out Sky News for reporting on Eurovision banning Russia from taking part in the upcoming song contest.\u00a0 However, Rihanoff has since apologised for the comments and clarified that she does not support Mr Putin or the invasion.\u00a0 For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live In a Twitter statement on Sunday, she wrote: \u2018I made fun of Eurovision tweet by Sky. I did think there was far more important information on that day that Eurovision. This is in any form says I was supporting what\u2019s happening at the moment between Russia & Ukraine. \u2018It\u2019s absolutely devastating for someone like me who\u2019s grandad from Ukraine and I have Ukrainian name to my daughter \u2013 Milena.

The country leaders should have found the way a long time ago to sort this peacefully but they didn\u2019t because war is profitable business and someone unfortunately making profit on this.\u2019\u00a0 The dancer then stated: \u2018I\u2019m not supporting Putin, war, invasion, lost lives and politics. I hate it as much as a human being possibly can. If I offended anyone it wasn\u2019t my intention and I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u2019\u00a0 Kristina clarified that she was born in Russia but left the country 22 years ago and was now an American citizen. She added: \u2018So you can hate me if this will give you comfort but if I didn\u2019t say something you wanted me to say it\u2019s because sadly I\u2019m powerless doing anything to help anyone in both countries and I don\u2019t believe in useless posts which can\u2019t help to safe lives. Russian President Putin is leading the invasion on Ukraine (Picture: Reuters) \u2018I can only hope and pray like everyone that this is over soon. And it\u2019s really sad that the hate is so powerful everywhere you look at the moment. The whole world is burning in it.\u2019\u00a0 One of her earlier tweets included a cartoon featuring caricatures of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. The three world leaders had been drawn with blood drawn on their hands, with Trudeau in blackface and PM Johnson holding a glass of wine, in reference to his lockdown party scandals. US President Biden was pointing to the distance, with the words \u2018Russian man bad\u2019 written in a speech bubble. Rihanoff tweeted alongside the illustration: \u2018Don\u2019t even have to say anything \u2013 pure genius.\u2019 The TV star later responded to an article shared by Sky News, announcing that Russia had been banned from Eurovision this year.

The United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog confirmed the disposal site close to the capital was hit by powerful explosives. As Ukraine enters its fifth day of war, authorities are monitoring the second nuclear scare of the conflict, days after Russian troops took control of Chernobyl. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said damage to storage sites could have \u2018potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment\u2019. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike, but there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material. He said his agency expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive testing. Such facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Mr Grossi said the two incidents highlight a \u2018very real risk\u2019. Russian soldiers have control over the Chernobyl, which is on a key route into the capital (Picture: Reuters) Energy facilities have been targeted by Russian bombing raids, including this petrol depot in Vasylkiv, near Kyiv, yesterday (Picture: EPA) Increased radiation levels have been detected around the site of the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear reactor, which lies around 100km north of the capital. The IAEA said the heightened gamma radiation levels do not not pose a risk to the public. An emergency meeting of the board which oversees the site of the world\u2019s worst ever nuclear disaster is due to take place later this week. The international body will discuss the \u2018safety, security and safeguard implications of the situation in Ukraine\u2019. The nuclear watchdog is particularly concerned that staff at the site have not been able to leave since Thursday. There are fears experts are being held to keep the site\u2019s critical safety processes working but will be exhausted as the conflict grinds on. A curfew which has been in place across the capital city all weekend ended this morning until tonight (Picture: Getty) The Ukrainian government said increased levels at Chernobyl were due to radiation material in the ground being disturbed by military vehicles. As speculation mounts that the Russian war effort is faltering, Vladimir Putin ratcheted up tensions by putting nuclear forces on high alert. The president cited \u2018aggressive statements\u2019 from Nato when he announced on television that weapons programmes would move to a heightened state of readiness.

A large number of soldiers and civilians have also been suffered in this war. According to reports, so far 198 people have lost their lives in the Russian attack. Amidst the ongoing war, the picture of a saint has been viral on social media. In this picture, St Javelin is holding an Anti Tank Missile Launcher in her hand. The picture of Saint Javelin is in the news amidst the terrible scene in Ukraine. People are posting the image of the same on social media with respect. People believe that the Saint Javelin encourage them and are also expecting her to protect them. Who is Saint Javelin? Russian soldiers are continuously claiming to destroy many military bases in Ukraine, while Ukrainian soldiers also claim that they have shot down many Russian tanks and fighter planes. In the midst of the war, the picture of Javelin has become a face of courage for the people of Ukraine. The Javelin missile in the hands of the saint is encouraging the people of Ukraine. In fact, in the 1980s, American defense companies designed the Javelin missile. Its weight is about 50 pounds. The army of the country can fire it by keeping it on its shoulders. The Ukrainian army is largely dependent on this anti-tank missile launcher to compete with Russian troops. What is Javelin Missile? Javelin missiles are considered as a better weapon to destroy military vehicles, tanks and bunkers. These missiles use infrared technology to target their targets. Army personnel can easily target armored vehicles and tanks with this. In the year 2018, Ukraine had purchased this weapon from America.

        "content": "Washington:\u00a0Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has activated Starlink, his commercial internet network, in Ukraine, with \"more terminals en route\".\"Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,\" Musk wrote on Twitter. According to Politico, Musk's SpaceX has thousands of Starlink satellites in orbit, which allow the company to beam broadband services around Earth, without the need for fiber-optic cables. The satellites could keep Ukraine online if its internet infrastructure is damaged by Russia's attacks, the report said. Musk's move came in response to a plea by Ukraine's First Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, who called for help on Saturday, as Ukraine fought off an invasion and sustained cyberattacks by Russian forces. \"While you try to colonise Mars -- Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space -- Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand,\" tweeting directly to Musk, Fedorov said. A recent report said that Musk's Starlink project is an ambitious attempt to install a grid of satellites in the Earth's orbit to provide internet access across the globe. SpaceX has thus far put more than 1,700 Starlink satellites into orbit, and the company plans on launching more than 40,000 in total.

As Russia continues to invade Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing the country seeking safety. What 4 champion boxers from Ukraine are doing in fight against Russia Many of them traveled across borders and were met by volunteers on the other end. World Central Kitchen, which responds to many crises around the globe and even right here in California during the wildfires, is one of those nonprofits feeding thousands crossing the border. KRON4 spoke with the director of emergency response who left San Francisco three days ago to help Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland. \"Look these are people that are displaced, don't have a home, don't know where they're going to get their next meal,\" said Sam Bloch who is the director of emergency response of World Central Kitchen. World Central Kitchen is helping solve one of those problems for thousands of people fleeing ukraine. Bloch traveled from San Francisco to Poland a few days ago to ensure that people crossing the Ukrainian-Poland border each day are being met with food, water, and other resources. \"One of the borders where we're set up with thousands of hot meals every day is a main pedestrian border so we got about 10,000 people each day walking across that border and some of them... I talked to a young lady today who walked 60 kilometers, and it was snowing today,\" Bloch said. \"It's really cold. To walk 60 kilometers and then we're waiting in line to exit Ukraine for 12 hours -- no food, no water. It was the first hot meal she had in three days.\" County breakdown: Where CDC recommends you wear a mask in Bay Area Bloch says most of the people he sees are families made up of women and children. \"You can see behind me these people are just coming and these buses are just making laps to and from the border, bringing people to what is essentially what you guys would equate to a Walmart parking lot and from there just figuring it out,\" he said. \"A lot of people are unsure. There are accommodation centers getting set up, thousands of people.\" In addition to their work in Poland, World Central Kitchen is also supporting local restaurants preparing meals in Odesa and lviv, which are two cities in Ukraine. The nonprofit is also preparing a response to families arriving in Romania and Moldova. \"We don't know it's estimated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have left and we don't know how many more hundreds of thousands will leave if not millions, as well as how long it is before they're able to return home, so however long it is and however many it is we're prepared to do what we need to do,\" Bloch said. Chef Jose Andres, who founded World Central Kitchen, also took to Twitter, committing million-dollar donations to Ukraine from the Jeff Bezos Courage and Civility Award. which he was a recipient of last year.",

Weibo appealed to users to be \"objective and rational\" when discussing international news. China's social-media platforms have deleted posts and banned thousands of accounts following a flood of \"vulgar\" content online mocking the invasion of Ukraine.On Sunday, Twitter-like service Weibo said it had banned 10,000 accounts and removed more than 4,000 posts that \"ridiculed war\" and mocked the situation in Ukraine. Besides misinformation, Weibo said offending posts include \"vulgar content\" related to jokes about Ukrainian women.\u00a0\"The platform continues to investigate and deal with inappropriate and unfriendly remarks related to 'Ukrainian beauties', which promote hatred and sexism,\" Weibo said in a separate post a day earlier.Since the invasion of Ukraine began on Thursday, Chinese internet users have gone online to weigh in on the subject.Amid the discussions, crude jokes about taking in fleeing Ukrainian women began circulating, with the hashtag \"willing to shelter 18- to 24-year-old Ukrainian girls\" trending on Weibo before it was censored on Friday, per Nikkei Asia. Such posts sparked widespread anger among other users online, the outlet reported.In its Sunday post, Weibo appealed for users to remain \"objective and rational,\" and to participate in discussions \"reasonably\" when discussing international news.Douyin, China's version of TikTok, also removed videos and banned accounts as it cracked down on \"inappropriate\" content related to Ukraine.\u00a0\"Some users have taken advantage of trending events, improperly stoking the fire,\" Douyin said on Saturday. \"In particular, they have treated pain points as laughing points, publishing videos such as 'capturing Ukrainian beauties,' spreading inappropriate values and destroying the atmosphere of the platform.\"\u00a0The platform has since removed more than 6,400 videos and interrupted 1,620 live broadcasts, it said on Saturday.\u00a0The Chinese embassy in Ukraine called for calm in an open letter to Chinese citizens.\"The Ukrainians are going through difficulties and discomfort,\" it said on its WeChat account on Sunday. \"We need to understand them and not provoke them.\"On Sunday, the White House called on China to condemn Russia and Putin, per Reuters. To date, Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an \"invasion.\"The Chinese government has been making efforts to\u00a0\"clean up\" social media platforms and maintain public order online, pushing content platforms to more closely watch their users. In September, 14 Chinese online content platforms, including Weibo and Douyin, signed a collective declaration\u00a0to enforce \"self-discipline\" in the country's cyberspace.Earlier this month, Weibo banned accounts and deleted posts following targeted online attacks of Olympians at the Winter Games.Read the original article on Insider",

        "content": "Sanket Patil, hailing from Dombivli\u00a0in Maharashtra, was excited after getting admission in a Ukraine-based university for a medical course, but his happiness was short-lived as the east European country faced an attack by Russia minutes after he stepped into the educational institution's hostel on February 24. The 23-year-old student is now confined to the hostel there and is staring at an uncertain future. His family back home is worried about his safety and is praying for his return soon. Patil had appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) to pursue medical education in India. But, his father, who is a school teacher, could not afford the high fees of colleges here. The family then tried for his admission in the Bukovinian State Medical University at Chernivtsi in Ukraine. \"The fees in Ukraine were one-third of that charged here, hence I decided to get my son admitted there,\" Sanket's father Gokul Patil told reporters on Sunday. A delighted Sanket, with dreams of a bright future in his eyes, had left for Ukraine on February 23. He entered the university hostel on February 24 and within minutes, he got to know that Russia had launched the military offensive against Ukraine. Gokul Patil is now worried about his son's safe return. \"There is no one there to take care of him. I am worried about his safety. After getting into the hostel, he called us and said all is well, but then the war began,\" he said. A large number of Indians, mostly students, are stranded in Ukraine following Russia's attack on the country. India has begun evacuating them and over 900 people have been brought back since Saturday.",

Thousands of Canadians have marched in rallies across the country to show their solidarity for Ukraine and condemn Russia\u2019s invasion, which started Thursday and has seen widespread fighting across nearly the whole of Ukraine.

Federal ministers on Sunday left open the possibility of sending arms to Ukraine after an initial cache of guns worth $7 million was recently delivered. However, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly defended the decision not to expel Stepanov or recall Canadian diplomats from Moscow, saying it was important for Canada to communicate with Russia and understand what is happening on the ground in terms of events and public sentiment.

Bergen was at one point booed by some members of the crowd before organizers asked people to listen. \u201cConservatives today are standing with our government, with all Canadians in the push against Putin,\u201d Bergen told the hundreds of protesters, many wearing the blue and yellow colours of Ukraine and carrying Ukrainian flags or placards critical of the Russian leader.

        "content": "Ursula von der Leyen has argued that Kiev \u201cbelongs\u201d to the European Union The president of the European Commission has claimed that the EU wants to see Ukraine joining its ranks as a military conflict between Kiev and Moscow rages on. The official was short on specifics and did not provide a timeline for the potential accession, however. \u201cWe have a process with Ukraine that is, for example, integrating the Ukrainian market into the single market. We have a very close cooperation on the energy grid. So, many topics where we work very closely together,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday. \u201cOver time, they belong to us, they are one of us, and we want them in,\u201d she added. Kiev has long sought to join the block, however, the process has dragged on for years, with the EU being reluctant to promise membership to Ukraine, urging it to carry out reforms to tame corruption first. On Saturday, Zelensky asked the EU to make an \u201curgent\u201d decision on the country\u2019s membership. The appeal drew immediate support from Poland and Lithuania, who on February 23 signed a declaration saying that Kiev should be given the status of candidate for EU membership. Speaking on the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, Von der Leyen stressed a need for ceasefire, saying that it was \u201cimportant that the Ukrainian side agrees to the peace talks [with Russia]\u201d provided that Kiev is satisfied with the conditions. \u201cIn general, it is always better to have peace talks than to have a fight,\u201d she noted. Read more EU to send fighter jets to Ukraine The EU announced on Sunday that it would \u201cfinance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment\u201d to Ukraine. The block also banned Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik, accusing them of spreading \u201charmful disinformation.\u201d The measures were in addition to the raft of sanctions the block has imposed on the Russian economy, its banking sector as well as on hundreds of officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking about a potential impact of the penalties on the EU itself, Von der Leyen admitted that the sanctions might backfire. \"Yes, we know that every war comes at a cost,\" she said.",

        "description": "The IOC has called on international federations to cancel or move events planned in Russia and Belarus.",
        "content": "The IOC has called on international federations to cancel or move events planned in Russia and Belarus.Earlier this month, Ukrainian skeleton rider Vladyslav Heraskevych flashed a sign at the Olympics: \u201cNo war in Ukraine.\u201d On Sunday, he was hunkered down about 150 kilometers (90 miles) outside of his nation\u2019s capital with weapons nearby in case he needs to defend his country.\u201cI am a student,\u201d the 23-year-old said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI am not experienced in these type of things. But I am ready to stand strong and help in any way I can.\u201dWith Russian troops encircling the capital of Kyiv, Heraskevych was among a rapidly growing list of athletes from Ukraine and about two dozen other countries who sent an open letter to Olympic and Paralympic leaders, urging them to immediately suspend the Russian and Belarusian Olympic and Paralympic Committees.\u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, supported by Belarus, is a clear breach of the Olympic and Paralympic Charters \u2014 a breach that must be met with strong sanctions,\u201d said the letter addressed to IOC President Thomas Bach and his counterpart on the International Paralympic Committee, Andrew Parsons.Among those putting their names on the letter were four-time Olympian Paula Radcliffe of Britain, six-time Olympian Clara Hughes of Canada, two-time Paralympian Greta Neimanas and Beckie Scott, the Canadian Olympic champion who served a long term as head of the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s athlete commission.There were 34 Ukrainian athletes\u2019 names listed on the letter, many signing on behalf of their entire sports federations. The letter said more Ukrainians would have signed but \u201cit has been a challenge to speak with all athletes from Ukraine as they are seeking safety in bomb shelters.\u201d\u201cIf the IOC and IPC refuse to take swift action, you are clearly emboldening both Russia and Belarus violation of international law and your own Charters,\u201d the letter read.The advocacy group Global Athlete helped coordinate the letter, which also was signed by sliders from the U.S., Latvia and the Netherlands, members of the Russian fencing team, an independent athletes\u2019 group from Germany and the Belarus Sport Solidarity Athletes Federation.The International Olympic Committee has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, saying it violated the Olympic Truce. It has called on international federations to cancel or move events planned in Russia and Belarus and to stop using the countries\u2019 flags and national anthems.Neither the IOC nor the IPC have taken direct action against the countries themselves, however. The Paralympics start next Friday. Neither federation immediately responded to AP requests for comment on the letter.Among those signing the letter was Ukrainian freestyle skier Oleksandr Abramenko, whose embrace with a Russian athlete in Beijing was caught on camera and captured headlines.Heraskevych\u2019s \u201cno war\u201d banner did, too. After that gesture on Feb. 11, the IOC came out quickly and said Heraskevych would not face any sanctions for violating the Olympic rule that limits political protests on the field of play at the Games.\u201cThis was a general call for peace,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cFor the IOC the matter is closed.\u201dHeraskevych told the AP he left China in mid-February with a guarded sense of optimism; at the time, Russia was amassing troops along Ukraine\u2019s border but had not invaded.His hopes were quickly dashed. He spoke to the AP from Zhytomyr, about a two-hour drive from Kyiv. He was preparing to defend Ukraine\u2019s capital if called on.\u201cIt\u2019s quiet now,\u201d Heraskevych said. \u201cBut there is no safe place in Ukraine right now.\u201d",

        "description": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has put the world on edge. The military move by Russian President Vladimir Putin... The post Why Did Russia Invade Ukraine? FAQs About the Conflict That Has Shocked The World appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.",
        "content": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has put the world on edge. The military move by Russian President Vladimir Putin has left many people looking for information on how and why the conflict started. Here are answers to some key questions. Why did Russia invade Ukraine? Putin nurses a deep sense of grievance over the loss of Russia\u2019s power and influence since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine was formerly part of the Soviet Union but declared its independence in 1991. Having a prosperous, modern, independent and democratic European state bordering Russia was perceived as posing a threat to Russia\u2019s autocratic regime. If Ukrainians succeeded in fully reforming their country along lines of other western democracies, it would set a bad precedent for former Soviet countries and serve as an example for Russians who want a more democratic country. Putin also perceives that western democracies are in a weak and particularly vulnerable state \u2014 thanks in part due to Russian efforts to create discord and sow divisions in Europe and North America abroad \u2014 making this an opportune time to launch a major military adventure. Is this a war? Absolutely, both in the traditional and modern sense. It involves a military assault with air, sea and land forces being deployed in combination with sophisticated cyberattacks and relentless propaganda disseminated by conventional as well as social media. The invasion of Ukraine is just an expansion and escalation of the earlier hybrid war. It is a war that actually began after Ukraine\u2019s Revolution of Dignity, also known as Euromaidan, in 2013-14. That\u2019s when widespread protests by citizens who wanted a closer relationship with Europe led to the ouster of then-president Viktor Yanukovych, who had asked Russia for help to put down the protests. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Russia responded by illegally annexing Crimea, a section of Ukraine that touches the Russian border on the Black Sea. Russia also supplied military personnel, mercenaries and other resources in support of a small but militant minority of pro-Russian separatists in the largely Russian-speaking cities of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine\u2019s east. More than 14,000 Ukrainians have died since 2014 in fighting in the Donbas. Is the invasion tied to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea? Crimea was the only part of Ukraine to have a slight majority of Russians at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, 55 per cent of the peninsula\u2019s population voted for Ukraine\u2019s independence. Putin mistakenly believed that by successfully annexing Crimea by stealth and orchestrating an armed uprising in the Donbas, he would shake Ukrainian unity and prompt the southern and eastern provinces of the country to break away from the Kyiv government and seek to join the Russian Federation as a new territory to be known as Novorossiya, or \u201cNew Russia.\u201d That failed to happen, so the current invasion is an attempt to achieve a similar end using force on a massive scale. Is this a renewal of the Cold War? The term \u2018Cold War\u2019 refers to a period after the Second World War when the Soviet Union and Western democracies were aligned against each other in what was essentially an ideological battle between capitalism and communism. At the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union \u2014 the two great military powers in the world \u2014 engaged in a titanic ideological struggle by means of subversion, propaganda campaigns and proxy wars in the developing world. Putin and his inner circle are very much products of the Cold War and consider the breakup of the Soviet Union and its Communist Party dictatorship a humiliation. In that sense, the current conflict is a renewal or even a continuation of the Cold War because its goal is to restore Russia as America\u2019s greatest military rival. Putin is seeking to turn back the clock to a time when the Soviet Union and the West had defined and relatively stable \u201cspheres of influence\u201d in Europe. During that time, there was a military balance achieved through parity in nuclear arsenals. This was also known as the \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d policy, which suggested that neither the United States or the Soviet Union would go to war because the ensuing nuclear battle would be devastating for both countries and the rest of the world. How \u2018Russian\u2019 is Ukraine? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); According to the last full census taken in 2001, 17.3 per cent of the citizens of independent Ukraine identified themselves as ethnic Russians. This was a decline of almost five percentage points from 1989, reflecting in part an out-migration of Russians after the breakup of the Soviet Union. There was also a change of identification among Ukrainians who had claimed to be ethnically Russian in the late Soviet period when it was socially and economically advantageous to do so, but reverted to their Ukrainian identity when Ukraine became independent. Since 2001, the numerical influence of ethnic Russians in Ukraine diminished even further, as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the creation of the two separatist \u201crepublics\u201d in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Significantly, even in the Donbas, where ethnic Russians form a substantial minority, they do not outnumber ethnic Ukrainians. Somewhat confusing the situation is the fact that most Ukrainians are able to speak or easily understand both Russian and Ukrainian. For many Ukrainians, especially in the south and eastern regions of the country, Russian is the first language. Russian is widely used throughout large parts of Ukraine and it is not unusual for people to easily and even unconsciously move back and forth between languages. Nor is it unusual that many Russian speakers are fervent Ukrainian patriots, just as significant numbers of ethnic Russians are fiercely loyal citizens of Ukraine. Russians and Russian speakers are not persecuted or discriminated against in Ukraine, even as the Ukrainian state \u2014 and increasingly Ukrainian citizens themselves \u2014 work to encourage fluency and the use of Ukrainian in daily life after centuries of linguistic and cultural Russification. Finally, a large number of Ukrainians have ties to Russians and Russia, through mixed marriages, work, professional relations and longstanding friendships. Sadly, many of these relations have been strained in recent years due to the Putin government\u2019s hostility towards Ukraine and the Russian media\u2019s relentless and baseless attacks on Ukrainians. The situation has resulted in contacts being terminated for political reasons as a result of changing attitudes towards Russia as a whole. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The vast majority of Ukrainians until recently had a positive image of Russia, but a growing number now have a critical or skeptical attitude to Russia. The current conflict is certain to make things worse. Why does Putin say Ukraine isn\u2019t a real country? In a televised speech days before the invasion, Putin suggested that \u201cmodern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia.\u201d Putin has inherited much of his world view from the Russian-chauvinist and Russocentric traditions of the former imperial and Soviet Russian regimes. His Ukrainophobic attitudes can be attributed in part to his being steeped in deeply rooted feelings of both Russian superiority and resentment towards Ukrainians who have consistently asserted their distinct identity. Russia has for four centuries tried to fully subjugate Ukrainian lands and to subdue the Ukrainian nation by means of laws and policies designed to undermine and suppress the Ukrainian language and culture, while at the same time privileging Russians in Ukraine. Russia has often resorted to using brutal force to prevent Ukraine from pursuing greater autonomy as well as outright independence, using invasions, ruthlessly crushing rebellions, exiling hundreds of thousands to Siberia and the Far North, starving millions in a genocidal famine, and simultaneously imprisoning and executing legions of gifted artists, intellectuals, spiritual leaders and political activists, who dared to challenge Russian dominance over the country. As various attempts by Ukrainians to establish an independent state were thwarted by Russia and by other foreign oppressors, Putin has repeatedly sought to disparage Ukraine\u2019s successful declaration of independence in 1991 and is determined to put an end to it.

        "content": "Demonstrators turned out across Europe in a weekend of anti-war sentiment Huge anti-war protests have been seen across Europe and around the world amid a global backlash to Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands \u2013 and possibly millions \u2013 of demonstrators marched against the Russian attack, in cities stretching from Berlin to Baghdad via Quito and Copenhagen. Eastern Europe was awash with demonstrators, including brave activists inside Russia, who are being arrested in their hundreds every day. In London, thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square on Sunday after demonstrators gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kensington on Saturday, when a punch was thrown at a man carrying a Russian flag. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live They were joined around the world by demonstrators in Prague, Madrid and Amsterdam, among other cities. Dressed in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukraine flag and bearing posters crying \u2018No World War 3\u2019 countless anti-war demonstrators took to the streets to denounce the Russian invasion. Demonstrators chanted \u2018shame\u2019 to Putin, while others waved banners with slogans like \u2018Putin murderer\u2019 or \u2018stop the monster\u2019. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square on Sunday (Picture: Getty Images) Organisers believe half a million people demonstrated in Berlin (Picture: Getty Images) One man in Prague, Czech Republic, compared Putin to Hitler (Picture: AFP) In the German capital, police estimated turnout as at least 100,000, while Prague drew 70,000 and Amsterdam 15,000. Organisers of the Berlin protest believe the real numbers was five times the police estimate, with demonstrators massing at the Brandenburg Gate, a stone\u2019s throw away from the Russian embassy. Hans Georg Kieler, 49, explained: \u2018It is important to me for Germany to show that it is standing for democracy in Europe.\u2019 He voiced approval for Germany\u2019s decision to begin delivering armaments to Ukraine, but said he thought \u2018we could have helped Ukraine more\u2019. Meanwhile, in Russia\u2019s second city of St Petersburg, around 400 people gathered in defiance of strict protest laws, holding posters that read \u2018No to war\u2019, \u2018Russians go home\u2019 and \u2018Peace to Ukraine\u2019. Thousands came out in solidarity with Ukraine at Dam Square, Amsterdam, in the Netherlands (Picture: Getty Images) Ukrainian and Spanish people gathered in Madrid (Picture: Getty Images) There was condemnation of Putin and calls for peace in the Spanish capital (Picture: Getty Images) More than 2,000 people were detained in demonstrations across the country on Sunday, following thousands of arrests this week, but they stood firm. Police in full riot gear were grabbing one protester after another and dragging some into police vans, even though the demonstration was peaceful. Footage from Moscow showed police throwing several female protesters on the ground before dragging them away. \u2018It is a shame that there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of us and not millions,\u2019 engineer Vladimir Vilokhonov, 35, said from the St Petersburg rally. Another demonstrator, 48-year-old Dmitri Maltsev, added: \u2018I have two sons and I don\u2019t want to give them to that bloody monster. War is a tragedy for all of us\u2019. The Kremlin has sought to downplay the protests, insisting that a much broader share of Russians support the assault on Ukraine. Demonstrators in Prague, Czech Republic, suggested turn out there may have been good because of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Russia (Picture: AFP) In St Petersburg on Sunday, Russian policemen detained a protestor during another rally against the invasion of Ukraine (Picture: EPA) Hundreds of Russians have been arrested every day amid protests (Picture: AFP) According to the OVD-Info rights group that tracks political arrests, by Sunday evening police had detained at least 1,474 Russians in 45 cities over anti-war demonstrations that day. Elsewhere, several thousand people gathered in Rome\u2019s city centre, answering a call from Italy\u2019s 235,000-strong Ukrainian community to demonstrate. In Prague, tens of thousands gathered at the central Wenceslas Square, including Roman Novotny, who had to travel around 300 kilometres (186 miles) to get to the protest from the southeast of the country. \u2018We all have to do our best,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult situation because the madman has nuclear weapons. I think he has cut himself off from the entire world, totally.\u2019 Student Eliska Lipkova, 19, said the strong mobilisation may be \u2018because we have a similar and rather recent experience, we were in a similar situation,\u2019 referring to the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet-led armies. At least 11 dead in Indonesia earthquake as rescuers desperately search rubble Meanwhile in Lithuania, Belarussian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya led a few hundred of her countrymen in protest against the Minsk regime for allowing Putin\u2019s army to use the country as a launchpad into Ukraine. Chanting \u2018long live Belarus\u2019 and \u2018glory to Ukraine\u2019, they said they wanted the world to understand that ordinary Belarusians do not support the attack on Ukraine. \u2018Our Ukrainian brothers would not forgive us for our silence\u2019, Ms Tikhanovskaya \u2013 who lives in exile in Lithuania \u2013 said. In Denmark, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen joined 10,000 people in front of the Russian embassy in Copenhagen to condemn the invasion. \u2018It is all of you and all of Europe who are threatened by Russia\u2019, she told the crowd. \u2018We cry with you\u2019, she said, addressing Ukrainians.

        "content": "Kiev maintains that Russia\u2019s claim that it subjected the people of Donbass to \u201cgenocide\u201d is baseless The highest UN court has confirmed it received an application by Ukraine asking it to launch proceedings against Russia under the so-called \u201cGenocide Convention.\u201d Accusing Moscow of \u201cplanning\u201d to commit acts of genocide against Ukranians, Kiev denied accusations that it itself has waged genoicide against the people of Lugansk and Donetsk republics. In a press release on Sunday, The International Court of Justice - the principal judicial body of the UN - has revealed that Kiev formally requested that the court establishes its jurisdiction over the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine so that its case against Russia can be considered under the provisions of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crimes of Genocide. In its filing, Kiev said that it \u201cemphatically denies\u201d the allegation by the Kremlin that it has targeted the population of the newly-recognized republics in what Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier insisted was a 8-year-long \u201cgenocide.\u201d Read more Ukraine calls on WHO to stop cooperating with Russia \u201cThe Russian Federation has falsely claimed that acts of genocide have occured in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine, and on that basis recognized the so-called \u2018Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u2019 and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic\u2019,\u201d Kiev\u2019s application reads, as cited by the court. Kiev went on to make a counter-claim, accusing Russia of \u201cplanning acts of genocide in Ukraine\u201d and arguing that Russia has been \u201cintentionally killing and inflicitng seriois injury on members of the Ukranian nationality.\u201d The application does not provide any specific evidence of \u201cgenocide\u201d by the Russian forces. The Russian military has repeatedly stated that it strikes military infrastructure only, while accusing Kiev of trying to use civilians as \u201chuman shields.\u201d Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting on Sunday, Russia\u2019s envoy to organization, Vasily Nebenzya argued that the \u201ccrisis\u201d in Ukraine began not with the launch of Russia's \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, but \u201cmuch earlier, when you [the international community] had turned a blind eye on the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists in Donbass.\u201d The application asks the court to rule on \u201cprovisional measures\u201d against Russia \u201cin order to prevent irrepatable prejudice to the rights of Ukraine ans its people and to avoid aggravating or extending the disputa between the parties under the Genocide Convention.\u201d The International Court of Justice, which is based in the Hague similarly to the International Criminal Court, is vested with the power to rule on legal disputes between UN member-states. However, the UN court does not assign individual responsibility to potential war crimes. While the hearing on \u201cprovisional measures\u201d is expected to take place in the near future, the proceedings typically drag on for years. The Russian military offensive in Ukraine was launched early Thursday, with Putin stating that its goal was to \u201cdenazify\u201d and \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Ukraine, as well as to \u201cdefend\u201d the Donbass republics, that had been recently recognized by Russia. Ukraine, the US, UK, Germany, the EU and NATO have all accused Russia of launching an \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack on Ukraine. The West has since imposed several packages of sweeping sanctions targeting the Russian economy as a whole as well as Putin personally and dozens of other Russian top officials.",

        "description": "EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that the EU will send \u201cfighter jets\u201d to Ukraine as part of a multimillion euro arms package Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "The bloc\u2019s top diplomat said lethal aid will be delivered through Poland The European Union\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell has revealed that a 450 million Euro package of \u201clethal aid\u201d for Ukraine will include fighter jets, with all weapons delivered through Poland. Borrell also said that around half of the Russian Central Bank\u2019s reserves would be frozen. Speaking hours after EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the bloc would \u201cfinance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment\u201d for Ukraine, Borrell revealed that the EU\u2019s \u201clethal aid\u201d package would amount to 450 million euros ($501 million), with another 50 million euros ($55,744) going toward non-lethal aid, including fuel and medical supplies. \u201cCertainly, we are going to supply arms\u2026we are even going to provide fighting jets,\u201d Borrell told reporters. \u201cWe are not just talking about ammunition.\u201d Borrell added that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had requested fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots could operate, and that such jets could be procured from certain EU countries. The Ukrainian Air Force uses Soviet-designed MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-24, Su-25, and Su-27 jets in combat roles, and with the Su-25 used by Bulgaria and the MiG-29 used by Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia, the jets will likely be sourced from these countries. Read more EU reveals major update on weapons for Ukraine Borrell said that military aid will be delivered to Ukraine via Poland, though he did not specify whether the jets would be flown into Ukraine or driven across the border. The EU\u2019s top diplomat also announced that financial sanctions would freeze \u201cabout half of the financial reserves of the Russian central bank.\u201d Half of Russia\u2019s reserves are in banks in G7 countries, Borrell stated, explaining that the EU can not block the other half located in Russia or elsewhere. While individual EU nations, as well as the UK and US, have promised caches of military aid to Ukraine in recent days, the bloc\u2019s move is an unprecedented one.\u00a0 It comes four days into Russia\u2019s military offensive on Ukraine, which was launched after months of negotiations with the west over Kiev\u2019s aspirations of NATO membership failed. Russia has long considered the idea of Ukraine joining the alliance an unacceptable security risk, yet leaders in Kiev, Washington, and Brussels refused to rule out membership for Ukraine in the Cold War-era pact. Delegations from Ukraine and Russia plan to meet in Belarus on Monday for tentative negotiations.\u00a0",

It comes as fierce street fighting broke out in Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, as Russian forces continue to advance on Kyiv.

Strategic ports in the country\u2019s south are also coming under attack \u2013 but stern resistance from the Ukrainians has slowed the advance. Earlier on Sunday, Kyiv was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports.

Boy, 17, killed as car crashes into taxi with three arrested Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea. He said the Russian forces also took control of an airbase near Kherson and the Azov Sea city of Henichesk. Cutting Ukraine\u2019s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country\u2019s economy. The country\u2019s authorities have also reported fighting near Odesa, Mykolaiv and other areas.

Hours later, a top EU official outlined further sanctions and a ban on some pro-Kremlin media outlets. The number of casualties so far from Europe\u2019s largest land conflict since the Second World War remains unclear amid the fog of combat. Ukraine\u2019s health minister reported on Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties. Russia has not released any casualty information but claimed losses were \u2018many times\u2019 lower than Ukraine\u2019s \u2013 though Ukraine claims it is actually far higher.

        "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" typically dedicates its cold open to a satirical take on a major news event - usually political - that happened during the week. On Saturday, the NBC show took a different angle.",
        "content": "(NEXSTAR) - The opening segment of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" known as the cold open, is typically dedicated to a skit bringing humor to a recent event. During its most recent episode, \"SNL\" used its cold open to pay tribute to the people of Ukraine. Saturday's episode opened with \"SNL\" cast members Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong introducing the Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York. The group of singers, wearing traditional outfits, sang \"Prayer for Ukraine.\" In front of them was a table with candles spelling out \"Kyiv,\" Ukraine's capital city. Surrounding the table were bouquets of yellow flowers, half of Ukraine's national colors, which are yellow and blue. Potent protest: Bars drop Russian vodka, promote Ukraine\u2019s After the choir's somber performance, McKinnon and Strong returned to deliver the customary line that begins each show - \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.\" The camera then focused on the table of candles before cutting to the commercial break. You can watch the full cold open here. Later on in the show, Colin Jost and Michael Che dedicated much of their segment, \"Weekend Update,\" to discuss Ukraine. Breaking from tradition, there were no feature character guest cameos during Saturday's \"Weekend Update.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a \"military operation\" in Ukraine on Thursday. Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said Russia doesn\u2019t intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice. Delta suspends codesharing with Russia\u2019s Aeroflot airline Sunday, Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces\u00a0put on high alert in response to what he called \u201caggressive statements\u201d by leading NATO powers. The order means Putin wants Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons prepared for increased readiness to launch and raises the threat that Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the West\u2019s response to it could boil over into nuclear warfare. Earlier Sunday, Kyiv was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. \u201cThe past night was tough \u2013 more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Until Sunday, Russia\u2019s troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million about 12.4 miles south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine. Elon Musk: Starlink internet service now active in Ukraine Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. One showed Ukrainian troops firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby. The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine\u2019s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend Kyiv and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.

        "content": "A small number of soldiers also ended up captured by Ukrainian forces, the Russian Defense Ministry said The Russian military has suffered casualties, and some soldiers have ended up captured by the opposing forces during the ongoing military operation in Ukraine, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov acknowledged on Sunday during a press briefing, as he provided a daily update on the conflict. \u201cSince the launch of the operation, [Russian military] has destroyed 254 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 31 aircraft on the ground, 46 multiple launch rocket systems, 103 pieces of artillery and mortars, 164 pieces of special military vehicles,\u201d Konashenkov stated. Russian soldiers are showing courage and heroism as they carry out combat missions of the special military operation. Unfortunately, there are killed and wounded among our comrades. The official did not specify the number of casualties among Russian troops, stating only that they are \u201cmany times less than the number of eliminated nationalists,\u201d as well as casualties suffered by Ukraine\u2019s regular military forces. A small number of Russian servicemen have been taken prisoner by Ukrainian troops, Konashenkov admitted, condemning the treatment they\u2019ve received at the hands of the opposing force. Read more Ukraine vows not to surrender \u201cWe know how the Ukrainian Nazis treat the few captured Russian servicemen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we see that the abuse and torture are the same as those of the German Nazis and their henchmen in the Great Patriotic War.\u201d The Russian military has been closely monitoring footage purportedly showing the abuse of the country\u2019s soldiers at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists, the official warned, promising to bring those involved in such behavior to justice. \u201cThis applies to the leaders of the Kiev regime and their minions, who directly call for abuse of Russian military personnel in violation of the convention on the treatment of prisoners of war,\u201d Konashenkov said. \u201cAll of you will be found and will inevitably face severe retribution.\u201d Any Ukrainian soldiers who ended up captured by Russian troops, however, are \u2013 and will be \u2013 treated \u201cdecently,\u201d the official stressed. \u201cAll who laid down their arms and ceased resistance will be returned to their families,\u201d Konashenkov added. Moscow launched the military operation in Ukraine on Thursday, explaining it was the only option left to prevent an allegedly looming attack by Kiev\u2019s forces on the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics in the country\u2019s east. Kiev has denied harboring such plans, insisting it has not been seeking to retake the region, which broke away from Ukraine back in 2014 after the Maidan events. Days before the offensive was launched, Moscow formally recognized the republics as independent states. The Ukrainian government slammed the attack as \u201cunprovoked.\u201d",

        "content": "Ukraine war implications for IndiaUkraine war implications for IndiaFebruary 24, Ukrainian cities and airports were attacked by Russian troops with planes and missile launchers. Chernobyl was captured. Oil depots and bridges were damaged. It was a full-scale attack. Citizens are now desperately fighting for their survival and to defend the capital. Defence experts have called it the \"most significant European war in eight decades.\" There are questions such as why the invasion took place, how the West/NATO would react, and whether this would lead to World War III. Other countries, mostly NATO members, are mulling to provide aid to Ukrainians, with Germany and US already beginning arms supplies and other aid. Well, while it is still a developing situation, there are many lessons the world should learn from it, more so India and its political leaders. The first and foremost lesson is that our politicians should rise to the occasion and show absolute solidarity with the government of the day in times of crisis. It is interesting to see how Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik was seen holding a Kalashnikov. She said she was very angry because \"a crazy dictator\" was telling them to leave their country, their town and family. She started organising a resistance group. Inspired by her, more women like beauty queen Anastasiia Lenna are also taking to arms. Not just that, one needs to admire the grit shown by Ukraine President Volodymr Zelensky who told US that he needs guns not a ride. It is time we understand the evolving global situation. Our political executive and political parties which are hiring strategists to come to power should not treat this as something happening somewhere over 5,000 km away. In the recent past, we saw the kind of comments by the opposition on the surgical strike and Galwan conflict. This kind of attitude in matters of defence needs to change and more matured behaviour should be displayed. In view of strained relations with China and Pakistan and many incidents of violent conflicts with both, Ukraine war should spur India to lay greater emphasis on manufacturing its own weapons as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Secondly, it should incorporate civil defence training and a sort of home guards system in the education system so people can rise to the occasion in times of need. This was part of high school education till a couple of decades back. Merely beefing up schools infra under fancy names, as is the case now, would not help. On the other hand, a belligerent China posing Ukraine-like threat to Taiwan is a signal for us to steel ourselves to face any subsequent bid by China to make inroads into our territories. If US does not go to Taiwan's aid in the event of China attack, just as it has not sent troops to defend Ukraine, we should strategise to fend for ourselves, not looking for help from other countries to stave off the Chinese threat. Let us hope Russia sees the reason and peace would prevail. The lesson in this for India is not to be complacent and to evolve suitable strategies. Let us also hope the opposition parties in the country will also become more sensitive to the grave situation and draw lessons to work in nation's interests.",

Like all wars the current war, of any proportion, would plunge the economy in turmoil.

A close eye will be kept on the developments concerning the Russia \u2013 Ukraine crisis and considering the inflation overhang, market participants will also observe movements in energy prices,\" said Shrikant Chouhan, head (equity research-retail), Kotak Securities Ltd. On Friday, benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty rebounded up to 2.5 per cent, a day after suffering their worst session in about two years, amid bargain hunting by participants. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 1,328.61 points or 2.44 per cent to settle at 55,858.52. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty soared 410.45 points or 2.53 per cent to 16,658.40. On a weekly basis, however, the Sensex lost 1,974 points or 3.41 per cent and the Nifty gave up 618 points or 3.57 per cent. Experts believe while markets have seen a pullback, volatility is expected to remain high over the next few days. \"Market will be keeping a close watch on the ongoing Russia - Ukraine conflict over the weekend for any further cues. For the near term, Thursday's low of 16200 may act as a strong support. While traders need to remain cautious of sharp volatility, investors can use the current dip to gradually add quality blue chip companies in their portfolios,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head (retail research), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Besides, auto shares will be in focus as automobile companies will start announcing their monthly sales numbers for February from March 1 onwards. Moreover, market participants will be awaiting cues from domestic macroeconomic numbers. The National Statistical Office (NSO) will declare the GDP estimates for Q3 FY 2021-22 on February 28. On the global front, Russia has unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities in what appeared to be the next phase of its invasion. The US and EU have responded with weapons and ammunition for the outnumbered Ukrainians and powerful sanctions on Russia. \"While the developments on the Russia-Ukraine front will keep influencing the directions of the market, resumption of supply disruptions and commodity inflation will hurt a lot of economies at a time when they were starting to recover post Omicron threat,\" said Deepak Jasani, head (retail research), HDFC Securities.",

        "description": "Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne winner reflects on Russo-Ukrainian War after beating Ewan",
        "content": "Speaking in the Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne press room after his victory on Sunday afternoon, Fabio Jakobsen ran through all the standard lines of questioning following the race \u2014 team tactics, the hills, the finishing sprint \u2014 but it was what he said after many of the assembled journalists had dispersed that stood out.After initially putting down the microphone and readying for the exit after a long round of press obligations, the Dutchman picked it up again to address the room unprompted.\"My mind and my prayers are with the people in Ukraine and the east of Europe,\" he said. \"Let's hope it doesn't escalate any further and we get peace over there because for us it's nice to be here and enjoy bike racing again.\"Here, it's 25-year-old guys fighting on a bike for a win and there, it's the 25-year-old guys like me fighting for freedom and their life. It's not a nice time over there and here we enjoy this, but my mind is over there and that puts things in perspective.\"It was a serious and thought-provoking way to end a day that had earlier seen Ukrainian Mark Padun dedicate his Gran Cami\u00f1o stage victory to his fellow citizens back home. The comments highlighted the maturity of the QuickStep-AlphaVinyl sprinter who has only recently fought through life- and career-threatening injuries himself. Read moreFabio Jakobsen wins Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne Jakobsen not necessarily Plan A for QuickStep-AlphaVinyl at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne Jakobsen dismisses idea of a QuickStep-AlphaVinyl sprinter rivalry with Cavendish He is, of course, now fully recovered from that litany of injuries suffered in Poland a year and a half ago. A \"big, big question\" posed to him during the post-race presser centred on how the team can now rely on him fully following his recovery.\"Pressure I think is something that that comes with top sport and especially being a sprinter,\" Jakobsen replied. \"You're usually in the position where the whole team works for you and relies on you, and I think that is one of the moments that you feel most alive. For sure I do.\"Last year going into the Vuelta it was not really a bonus anymore. We were already planning on sprinting for the win. There, the guys said, 'we think you are one of the fastest in the peloton so we're going to just work for you fully and try to win'.\"I had a normal winter. I trained a lot with the guys, and we did a lot of sprints so I could really feel that I was getting back to the level I was before the crash. I'm grateful for that. It's not been easy getting here but now at least I feel like a normal professional rider again.\"With his success in Kuurne, Jakobsen now has five wins to his name in 2022, more than anyone else in the peloton \u2014 even if the biggest goals of the season still lie some months ahead.Currently, he can lay claim to being the fastest man in the peloton. He modestly says top five, though he hasn't yet measured himself against every top sprinter, including the likes of Jasper Philipsen, double stage winner in the UAE Tour.\"It feels good. I like to be the fastest,\" he said. \"I still love speed. God gave me a couple of fast legs and I'm happy I can show it and sprint for the win.\"I think you're always the fastest for a day. I would put myself in the top five of sprinters and probably today I was the fastest. I have not been able to measure myself to the guys in the UAE, but I would like to, and I look forward to that. So, for today I think I was the fastest in the world before the start.\" A late breakaway catch and Lefevere's motivation Jakobsen with the traditional Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne 'trophy' on the podium (Image credit: Gregory Van Gansen/SprintCyclingAgency\u00c2\u00a92022) One of those traditional reference points for the best sprinters in the peloton \u2014 along with the Tour de France and Scheldeprijs, which he has won twice before \u2014 is Milan-San Remo. Jakobsen has already said that the race is not in his plan this season, but said on Sunday that he would like to take it on.\"You would need to talk to the team management about that. For sure, I dream about Milan-San Remo, but maybe this year is too soon. I'm going to do Paris-Nice and then see what comes after, but the shape is there, and I feel good so if there's a spot available then, of course, I'd like to race there.\"The challenge at La Classicisma would be the hills, specifically the Poggio, which in recent years has thwarted the sprinters more often than not. At Kuurne, though, Jakobsen coped fine with the challenges thrown in his path \u2014 from the usual cobbled Flandrian bergs to the newly added Walloon hills. They draw to a close far from the line, but still, you can only ride what's in front of you.\"I was in a nice spot because I know I've got teammates who can be in the first group,\" Jakobsen said. \"So, I just needed to position myself in the first 50 but I did notice that if I started in position 30 I was passing guys, so I was not dropping back and that's good for the mind.\"Then you know that you have legs, so I was never really in trouble but always within reach of the first group and easily in the second group. I do feel the legs burning but I don't get dropped off the back so I wouldn't say it was easy, but it was doable and especially when you know the last hill is 50km from the finish, you just need to hang on and see if it becomes a bunch sprint.\"In the end \u2014 at the very last \u2014 it did become a bunch sprint, but only just. The remains of an attack group that jumped away at 60 kilometres to go was still out front well into the last kilometre, with Christophe Laporte, Taco van der Hoorn, and Jhonatan Narv\u00e1ez only caught as Jakobsen and his sprint rivals blew past within sight of the line.Jakobsen, his maths perhaps not exactly on point, said that it was a 50-50 chance that the peloton would make the catch, but noted that his mindset stays the same whether he's sprinting for a win or minor placings.\"It doesn't really matter because in the last 10 kilometres you just need to be focused on sprinting and if it's for a fourth place, then you sprint for fourth place,\" he said. \"But when it's 10 seconds, you know also in the front that they want to win so they probably look at each other a little bit. Then you can always come from the back.\"So, I launched my sprint at 300 to go, which is maybe a bit far, but when you dive into their slipstream, you can take some more speed and I think that's how I got a chance to keep Ewan in second place and finish first.\"The victory \u2014 just ahead of Caleb Ewan, leader of QuickStep's great Belgian rivals Lotto Soudal \u2014 ended up 'saving' the team's Opening Weekend, itself something of a mini-campaign within the wider context of the spring Classics.It came a day after QuickStep-AlphaVinyl had ended up with an anonymous ninth place to show for their efforts at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Team boss Patrick Lefevere \u2014 he of a considered opinion and calm temper \u2014 had had some choice motivational words in West-Vlaams dialect for the team on Saturday night, Jakobsen revealed.\"I don't speak the dialect,\" he laughed. \"We all understood\u2026 I was even a bit uncomfortable on my seat because if he starts talking and it's not in a happy nice way which is normal \u2014 this is top sport, we need to perform, and I don't think we were even on the TV cameras \u2014 I'm not going to go into detail, but it was not nice to be there. But it worked.\"",

        "content": "(AP) - Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on increased alert on Sunday in an unprecedented escalation of tension with the West over Russia\u2019s massive conventional assault of Ukraine, which entered its fourth day with fighting in the streets of the country\u2019s second-largest city. Here are the things to know about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the security crisis in Eastern Europe: RUSSIA PUTS NUCLEAR FORCES ON ALERT In a shocking move that immediately unearthed fears many thought permanently buried from the Cold War of the previous century, Putin ordered Russian\u00a0nuclear weapons prepared for increased readiness to launch, ratcheting up tensions with Europe and the United States over the conflict that is dangerously poised to expand beyond the former frontiers of the defunct Soviet Union. Watch: Missile hits apartment building in Kyiv The Russian president told his defense minister and the chief of the military\u2019s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in \u201cspecial regime of combat duty.\u201d He said that leading NATO powers had made \u201caggressive statements\u201d toward Russia in addition to stiff economic sanctions and cutting leading Russian banks from the SWIFT banking system. RUSSIA AND UKRAINE TO HOLD TALKS After rejecting Putin\u2019s offer to meet in the Belarusian city of Homel on the grounds that their common neighbor was facilitating the Russia assault, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to send a Ukrainian delegation to meet with Russian counterparts at an unspecified time and location on the Belarusian border. The announcement comes hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, a country that has supported Putin directly by allowing Russia to use its territory as a staging ground. Zelenskyy, who has refused to abandon Kyiv, named Warsaw, Bratislava, Istanbul, Budapest or Baku as alternative venues for talks, before accepting the Belarus border. Elon Musk: Starlink internet service now active in Ukraine The Kremlin added later that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had offered to help broker an end to fighting in a call with Putin. It didn\u2019t say whether the Russian leader accepted. FIGHTING SPREADS Attempting to lay siege to Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, Russian forces focused on cutting off the country\u2019s southern coast and isolating it from the sea, while also probing the inner defenses of Kharkiv. Ukrainians awoke Sunday to street fighting in the northeastern city of 1.4 million located about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) south of the border with Russia. Regional authorities administration said that Ukrainian forces had engaged Russian troops inside the city and asked civilians not to leave their homes. The immediate fate of the Russian advance was uncertain, but with Ukrainians volunteering en masse to fight back alongside regular army units, it seemed that the city\u2019s defenses offered stiff resistance. Having already ordered men between 18-60 years old not to leave the country, Ukrainian officials said Sunday that they were releasing prisoners with military experience who want to take up arms for their country. The ground attack came after Russians blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian officials who ordered residents to cover their windows with a damp cloth given the \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d it posed. Britain\u2019s defense ministry said that while overnight skirmishing in Kyiv had been less intense than on Friday night, Russian forces were attempting to encircle the city. The capital remains under lockdown after its mayor called a curfew from 5 p.m. Saturday until 8 a.m. Monday. Germany says it\u2019s sending anti-tank weapons, stinger missiles to Ukraine Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Sunday told The Associated Press that he estimated some of the Russian attackers are within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the city center and that he feared for a long siege. \u201cRight now, we have electricity, right now we have water, and heating in our houses, but the infrastructure is destroyed ... I guess we have not so much time,\u201d Klitschko said. MOST FLEE, SOME RETURN TO FIGHT Those fleeing Europe\u2019s largest armed conflict since World War II grew to 368,000 Ukrainians \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 who have reached neighboring countries, the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency said. That figure more than doubles the agency's estimate from the day before. The line of vehicles at the Poland-Ukraine border stretched 14 kilometers (8.7 miles), and those fleeing had to endure long waits in freezing temperatures overnight. Over 100,000 people have crossed into Poland alone, according to Polish officials. Amid the rush to escape the bombs and tanks, there was also what looked like a trickle of brave men and women who want to head home to defend Ukraine or help others do so. At a border crossing in southern Poland, Associated Press journalists spoke to\u00a0people in a line heading against the tide. They included a group of some 20 Ukrainian truck drivers who worked in Europe and wanted to face combat. GERMAN MILITARY SHIFT A day after Germany announced it would send military aid to Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his\u00a0government will increase its own defense spending\u00a0to rearm amid the uncertainty of the extent of Putin\u2019s ambitions. Scholz\u2019s pledge to dedicate 100 billion euros to a special fund for its armed forces would raise Germany's defense spending above 2% of GDP, finally satisfying a longstanding request by NATO allies for Europe\u2019s largest economy to do more for the continent\u2019s security. Increased levels of radiation measured at Chernobyl after Russian forces take control Late on Saturday Germany announced that it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 \u201cStinger\u201d surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. Those weapons are in addition to the 400 German-made anti-tank weapons Germany also approved to be shipped from the Netherlands, as well as 9 D-30 howitzers and ammunition from Estonia. MORE CLOSE AIRSPACE TO RUSSIA Italy and Austria joined a growing list of European countries to have closed their airspace to all Russian aircraft. They follow Britain, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Luxembourg.",

On Saturday, Abramovich surprisingly announced that he is giving his \u2018stewardship\u2019 of Chelsea to the trustees of the club\u2019s charitable foundation. Abramovich, who denies any link with Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, has made the move after the UK Government announced a list of sanctions against Russian banks, oligarchs and companies earlier this week. Chelsea followed this up with a brief statement on Sunday describing the \u2018situation\u2019 in Ukraine as \u2018horrific and devastating\u2019, but made no reference to Russia\u2019s aggression.

Everyone at the club is praying for peace.\u2019 When asked if Chelsea\u2019s statement which called for peace included Abramovich, Tuchel told Sky Sports: \u2018Absolutely, it includes him and it reflects my opinion and everyone else\u2019s within the club. Roman Abramovich remains in control of Chelsea but has handed his \u2018stewardship\u2019 over to the club\u2019s charitable trustees (Getty) Asked if he had spoken to Abramovich, Tuchel replied: \u2018No, we have not. \u2018Which is not unusual I have a daily conversation with Petr Cech and regular conversation with Marina [Granovskaia], they are both in charge in football and in my understanding they will stay in charge so that will not change a lot for me, actually \u2018I did also not say that is was \u2018difficult\u2019 it was just a distraction because we are aware and watching news. We are concerned and we are a bit shocked of the situation in Ukraine. \u2018At the end, approaching this final we allowed ourselves to be sportsman, to be football players and we try and allow to focus on this match and to a certain degree enjoy it. \u2018We know there are more important things out there than football.

Torbin previously fought in the conflict with the DPR and LPR. He was jailed for six years and six months in 2018 for his role in the murder of a civil rights activist and anti-corruption campaigner Kateryna Handziuk. The woman was doused with acid in July 2018 on a street outside her home and died in the hospital with severe burns later that year. Sinyuk said Torbin handpicked former inmates for his squad after his early release. He added that another ex-serviceman, Dmitry Balabukha, sentenced to nine years in jail for stabbing a man to death at a bus stop after an argument in 2018, had also been released.

        "content": "While countries like Poland and Hungary have welcomed fleeing Ukrainians, some foreign citizens seeking to leave Ukraine have reported difficulties at the Polish border. An Indian volunteer in Poland said Sunday some Indian citizens seeking to flee Ukraine into Poland are stuck at the border leading into Medyka, Poland, and unable to cross. The Indian Embassy in Kyiv said Sunday that Indian citizens are being evacuated from Ukraine to Romania and Hungary. But some have arrived at the border with Poland apparently unaware of this and are stuck. Ruchir Kataria, the volunteer, told The Associated Press that the Indians seeking to cross at Medyka were told in broken English: \u201cGo to Romania.\u201d But they had already made long journeys on foot to the border, and have no way to reach the border with Romania hundreds of kilometers away. Some other Indian citizens who managed to cross into Poland have been denied a place to stay in shelters set up by Polish authorities and charities, and were told that the help was reserved for Ukrainians, according to Kataria\u2019s wife, Magdalena Barcik, who is working with him to help those fleeing. European Union interior ministers are gathering Sunday for emergency talks on how to cope with an influx of refugees from conflict-hit Ukraine as tens of thousands of people flee across the border into Poland, Hungary, Romania and elsewhere. The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency says the latest count of Ukrainians arriving in neighboring countries stands at 368,000 and continues to rise. The U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, estimates that more than 200,000 people displaced by the fighting in Ukraine have fled the country, and that up to four million could flee if the fighting spreads. The update from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on Sunday more than doubles its estimate a day ago. Spokesman Chris Meizer said on Twitter that the line of cars at the Poland-Ukraine crossing stood at 14 km long (8.7 miles), and those fleeing \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 had to endure long waits in freezing temperatures overnight. Poland\u2019s government said Saturday that more than 100,000 Ukrainians had crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border in the past 48 hours alone. At a meeting in Brussels, the ministers will look at ways to shelter people, how to manage the security challenges that the conflict poses to the EU\u2019s external borders, and what kind of humanitarian support can be provided to Ukraine.",

The 53-year-old made 60 international appearances over the course of a distinguished career, 37 of which came for USSR before the break up of the old Soviet Union. After impressing against the Gunners for Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League, the versatile defender was snapped up by Arsene Wenger in the summer of 1999.

After hanging up his boots having finished his career with Venta after a short spell at Wolves, Luzhny has carved out a successful coaching career and had designs on returning to England before war broke out. Those plans have been put on the back burner, however, given the \u2018horrific\u2019 scenes which followed Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine earlier this week.

        "content": "Street fighting broke out in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city and Russian troops squeezed strategic ports in the country\u2019s south Sunday, advances that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia\u2019s invasion following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere in the country. Following its gains on the ground, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Ukraine\u2019s president suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion. Until Sunday, Russia\u2019s troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine. Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. One showed Ukrainian troops firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby. The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine\u2019s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces. RELATED: Canada, EU, U.S. disconnecting some Russian banks from SWIFT Ukraine\u2019s government also is releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight for the country, a prosecutor\u2019s office official, Andriy Sinyuk, told the Hromadske TV channel Sunday. He did not specify whether the move applied to prisoners convicted of all levels of crimes. \u201cWe are fighting, fighting for our country, fighting for our freedom because we have the right to do that,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. \u201cThe past night was tough \u2014 more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure. There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn\u2019t consider as admissible targets.\u201d Huge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday near Kyiv, where terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. A 39-hour curfew to keep people off the capital\u2019s streets until Monday morning complicated the task of assessing the intensity of the fighting. Zelenskyy\u2019s office said explosions were reported at Kyiv International Airport. Flames billowed from an oil depot near an airbase in Vasylkiv, a city 37 kilometers (23 miles) south of Kyiv where there has been intense fighting, according to the mayor. Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline to the east in Kharkiv, prompting the government to warn people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze as protection from smoke, the president\u2019s office said. Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn\u2019t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence. The pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine appeared aimed at seizing control of the country\u2019s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea. He said the Russian forces also took control of an airbase near Kherson and the Azov Sea city of Henichesk. Ukrainian authorities also have reported fighting near Odesa, Mykolaiv and other areas. Cutting Ukraine\u2019s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country\u2019s economy. It also could allow Moscow to build a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 and until now was connected to Russia by a 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge, the longest bridge in Europe which opened in 2018. The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency said late Saturday more than 200,000 Ukrainians have arrived in neighboring countries since the invasion started Thursday. The U.N. has estimated the conflict could produce as many as 4 million refugees, depending how long it continues. RELATED: \u2018We will win:\u2019 Ukraine accuses Russia of hitting infrastructure, civilian targets Zelenskyy denounced Russia\u2019s offensive as \u201cstate terrorism.\u201d He said the attacks on Ukrainian cities should be investigated by an international war crimes tribunal and cost Russia its place as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. \u201cRussia has taken the path of evil, and the world should come to depriving it of its U.N. Security Council seat,\u201d he said. Russia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods have been hit. Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to an international war crimes court in The Hague as possible crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court\u2019s prosecutor has said he is monitoring the conflict closely. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Sunday that Putin could use \u201cthe most unsavory means,\u201d including banned chemical or biological weapons, to defeat Ukraine. \u201cI urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict, but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons,\u201d Truss told Sky News.",

Medinsky,\u00a0an aide to President Vladimir Putin and former culture minister, added that the parties are now deciding on the logistics and the exact location of the summit, with \u201cmaximum security\u201d for the Ukrainians. \u201cWe guarantee that the travel route will be 100% safe. We will be waiting for the Ukrainian delegation,\u201d Russian chief negotiator said. The Russian team arrived in Gomel on Sunday, where it said talks were planned with the Ukrainians. Kiev later said it wanted to negotiate on \u201cneutral ground,\u201d arguing that Russian troops were using Belarusian territory to stage attacks on Ukraine. Minsk, however, denied that its forces were participating in the Russian operation. The Russians initially said their team would stay in Belarus until 3pm local time. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko over the phone, asking to move the deadline, according to Lukashenko\u2019s spokeswoman, Natalia Eismont. She said the Belarusian leader then spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who agreed to move the planned negotiations to a later time. Zelensky confirmed the call with Lukashenko on social media, but has not commented on the talks. Moscow attacked its neighbor this week, arguing that it was defending the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which broke off from the eastern part of Ukraine shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Ukraine said the move was an act of unprovoked aggression.",

I wouldn't even imagine stuff happening like that in the country next to me.\" Her remarks came a day after Russian men's star Andrey Rublev, playing in neighbouring Dubai, marked his semi-final win by signing a camera lens on court with the message, \"No war please\", clearly stating his feelings about his nation's invasion of Ukraine. Swiatek beat three top 10 players on her way to the Qatar title. The 2020 French Open champion now has two 1000-level titles after winning in Rome last year, where she crushed Karolina Pliskova 6-0, 6-0 in the final.

A day earlier, the 24-year-old Rublev had reportedly explained his stance in an interview. \"In these moments you realise that my match is not important. It's not about my match, how it affects me. Because what's happening is much more terrible,\" Rublev said. \"You realise how important it is to have peace in the world and to respect each other no matter what and to be united...

Nearly 200 people have been killed with over 1000 injured so far, and the violence is only pressing on. UK army generals have warned that the escalating violence could mean the UK \u2018could soon be at war with Russia\u2019 The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, warned earlier this week that Putin had gone \u2018full tonto\u2019 and the UK faced a busy adversary. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live However, he also added that the UK \u2018kicked the backside\u2019 of Tsar Nicholas I during the Crimean War, and \u2018we can always do it again\u2019, during a pep talk to military personnel in Westminster. According to the minister, Nicholas I \u2018made the same mistake Putin did\u2026 he had no friends, no alliances\u2019. But is this true?

Historically, yes, but it\u2019s not yet clear how each of these allies feel about the latest developments in Ukraine. Russia has some consistent allies, particularly the countries in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The EAEU is a political and economic union first proposed by Putin in 2011 and signed into being by initial member states Belarus and Kazakhstan alongside Russia. Armenia (a long term ally of Russia) and Kyrgyzstan were welcomed into the union in 2015. The EAEU are allies of Russia (Picture: Getty) Tajikistan has been touted as a potential future member, and an ally to Russia. A number of other countries have also been tipped to join in the future, including Moldova, Cuba and Uzbekistan. India also has a strategic partnership with Russia, after signing the Declaration on the India-Russia Strategic Partnership in October 2000, however, India have increasingly amiable relations to the US. Similarly, Pakistan have had a mixed relationship with Russia, having largely supported the West during the Cold War but also celebrated the 70th Anniversary of Diplomatic Relations with Russia in 2018. There are a number of other countries who maintain fair relations with Russia, though they might not be considered a straightforward ally. These include Israel and Turkey. Is China an ally of Russia? China is a Russian ally. Russia and China have signed a treaty which lasts until at least 2026 (Picture: Getty) In 2001, both countries signed the \u2018Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation\u2019, a 20-year pact which was renewed for five more years recently, now set to run until at least 2026. The treaty outlines the basis for peaceful relations and economic cooperation, as well as diplomatic and geopolitical reliance. Part of this treaty also expressly hinted at supporting one another in times of conflict, including the sharing of \u2018military know-how\u2019 and Chinese access to Russian military technology. Another key part of the Treaty is the agreement that Russia sees Taiwan as \u2018an inalienable part of China\u2019 \u2013 this mirrors the Ukraine situation and could imply that Russia would support a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, just as they invaded Ukraine. Have any Russian allies condemned the war in Ukraine? Though Russia does have some economic allies, most have condemned the violence taking place in Ukraine. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T3M8S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/27\\/07\\/54708331-0-image-a-66_1645948116569.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-27T07:46:56+0000\",\"description\":\"Former President Donald Trump condemned on Saturday (February 26) Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said he was praying for Ukrainians, switching tone from his praise for Russian President\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/27\\/3390357924948168640\\/640x360_MP4_3390357924948168640.mp4\",\"height\":360,\"width\":640} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call for \u2018an immediate cessation of violence\u2019 after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s announced war against Ukraine. In a phone call with Putin, Modi called for \u2018concerted efforts from all sides.\u2019 China said it will not provide Moscow with military support but it has been upping trade with increased imports of wheat from Russia. However, China\u2019s foreign minister stressed this week that each country\u2019s sovereignty should be respected, calling on parties to return to the negotiating table. Israel has also expressed concern at the actions taken by Putin. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid condemned Russia\u2019s move as \u2018a serious violation of the international order\u2019, but also stressed Israel\u2019s \u2018deep, long-lasting and good relations with Russia and with Ukraine\u2019. Turkey have taken something of a neutral stance. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Moscow\u2019s military actions amount to a \u2018heavy blow\u2019 to regional peace and stability and reiterated Turkey\u2019s \u2018call for a resolution of the problems between Russia and Ukraine\u2019. \u2018We cannot give up on either of the countries. We have political, economic and military relations with Russia, and we also have political, economic and military relations with Ukraine,\u2019 Erdogan said. Ukraine has received global support (Picture: Getty) Pakistan is another ally who have been tepid in their response to the invasion of Ukraine. In fact, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is the first world leader to have met with Putin after the invasion begun. Khan had gone to Moscow with the aim of enhancing economic ties with Russia, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of gas, at a time when Pakistan\u2019s energy needs are escalating. Which countries have supported Russia in their action against Ukraine? Myanmar have gone on record as calling the invasion of Ukraine \u2018justified.\u2019 Government spokesman Zaw Min Tun said Moscow\u2019s military had \u2018carried out what is justified for the sustainability of their country\u2019s sovereignty.\u2019 Myanmar has taken a pro-Russian stance (Picture: Getty) \u2018Russia shows its position to the world as a world power,\u2019 he added in the statement, which was also released in Russian. Venezuela have not openly supported the invasion of Ukraine, but they have condemned the US for allegedly aiding in the breaking of the Minsk agreement. \u2018The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expresses its worry over the worsening of the crisis in Ukraine, and laments the mockery and violation of the Minsk accords on the part of NATO, encouraged by the United States of America,\u2019 the ministry said in a statement. The Minsk agreements were a series of international agreements which sought to end the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Belarus has sided with Russia, insisting that they would send their troops to join Russia if needed. The Foreign Ministry of Belarus \u2013 which is currently engaged in military exercises with Moscow \u2013 said it viewed the move \u2018with respect and understanding.\u2019 Syria has also supported Putin\u2019s actions. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had a phone call with Putin where Al Jazeera report that he praised Russia\u2019s\u00a0military incursion\u00a0into Ukraine, denouncing what he called Western \u2018hysteria\u2019 surrounding it. Al-Assad told Putin what was happening in Ukraine was a \u2018correction of history and restoration of balance which was lost in the world after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\u2019 MORE : Russian banks cut from global finance system in major escalation of sanctions MORE : How to help the people of Ukraine as it comes under attack from Russia Follow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

        "content": "The group were in a bunker at a hotel in Kiev A group of Brazilian football players\u00a0who were stranded in the bunker of a Kiev hotel with their families have finally managed to safely flee the premises after intervention from\u00a0UEFA and the Ukrainian Football Association. Shakhtar Donetsk defender Marlon Santos confirmed the development by posting a video to Instagram from inside the train. The group\u00a0are headed to the city of Chernivtsi in western Ukraine, which allows access to the borders shared with Romania and Moldova. Santos's wife, Maria Paula Marinho, also showed part of the journey in an Instagram live session. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Marlon Santos (@marlonsantos_ms4) \"All of us that were in the bunker of a hotel in Kiev managed to get out of there,\" Marlon confirmed.\u00a0 \"The Brazilian Embassy gave this option of the train to us. [But] who gave all the escorted security to the train station was UEFA, together with the Ukrainian Football Federation.\u00a0Thank you all. [There are] no words to thank you. \"Now we're all on the train on a journey to the city of Chernivtsi, in the west of Ukraine, 535 kilometers from Kiev, near the borders of Romania and Moldova. Keep praying for us.\" The group of around 50 Brazilian players and their families, with children ranging from a few months old to six and seven years of age, took\u00a0a metro train\u00a0to the train station before embarking to\u00a0Chernivtsi.\u00a0 They were informed of the possible transport out of the Ukrainian capital at around 9am local time, as the Brazilian Embassy's Telegram channel spread information on trains leaving various cities in the country amid the Russian military operation. Read more Footballers \u2018shun offer from Brazilian foreign ministry\u2019 to leave Kiev Brazilian media outlets such as UOL\u00a0later reported that the group had managed to get the train, which should take around 11 hours to reach its destination before a bus provided by the Brazilian Embassy helps them over the border. The group's successful evacuation from Kiev comes after they first refused to take transport offered to them by Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, known as Itamaraty. \"We're still in the bunker at the Opera Hotel in Kiev,\"\u00a0confirmed Marlon at around 2am on Saturday morning.\u00a0\"We didn't try to get the train organized by the Brazilian Embassy. It would have been high-risk for all of us.\" \"We were told about the train at the last minute and without any security strategy,\"\u00a0explained football agent Augusto Nogueira, who represents Shakhtar's new 18-year-old right back Vinicius Tobias, to UOL. \"It was not feasible to go out and for everyone to move around. Even more so at that time. We are still here,\" Nogueira added, while citing the lack of security the group had to head to Kiev's Central Station as bombs could be heard from the Opera Hotel, where food and water supplies were said to be running out.\u00a0 Marlon claimed that each member of the group that was in the bunker at the Opera Hotel had managed to flee, including Shakhtar striker Junior Moraes. While the other players and their loved ones should be able to cross the border easily, however, Moraes may encounter difficulties\u00a0because he took Ukrainian citizenship in 2019. Ukrainian president\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky has put a ban on male citizens aged\u00a0between 18 and 60 leaving the country as part of a 90-day full military mobilization plan, with the organizers of the Ukrainian Premier League announcing earlier in the week that the competition would be halted for at least a month.",

        "content": "KABUL: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in a statement has called for restraint by the parties involved in the recent tensions in Ukraine, saying that all sides need to desist from taking positions that could intensify violence. MoFA on Friday also urged the involved parties to consider safeguarding the Afghan refugees and students based in Ukraine, TOLOnews reported.The Russian troops on Thursday launched an all-out attack on Ukraine hours after President Vladmir Putin announced that he had ordered a military operation in Ukraine. The Russian forces have targeted several cities of Ukraine. \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, in line with foreign policy of neutrality, calls on both sides of the conflict to resolve the crisis through dialogue and peaceful means,\" the statement said. Analysts believe that the issue of Ukraine will shift the attention of the international community from the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan. \"The issue of Ukraine draws the attention of the world. The Islamic Emirate should try to ramp up visits abroad to keep Afghanistan's relations with the world countries on track,\" said Maiwand Babakarkhail, a political analyst. Based on statistics, more than 50,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Bangladesh are living in Ukraine. Around 20,000 of them are Afghans. What will be the impact of the Russia-Ukraine' tension on Afghanistan? \"The Ukraine's issue will cause a reduction in attention of the world countries toward the Afghan migrants. The financial support of the European Union and other world countries will decrease,\" said Toreq Farhadi, a political analyst. \"The people of Afghanistan need of world now more than ever. Unfortunately, Ukraine's situation will cause Afghanistan to be forgotten by the world. This should not happen because the situation in Afghanistan is worse,\" said Ruslan Salmanov, a Russian journalist. Although, the Russia's invasion of Ukraine faced widespread reactions by many world countries, Iran and China \u2014 the two neighbouring countries of Afghanistan \u2014 remained silent. \"China is closely monitoring the latest developments. We call on all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control, said Hua Chunying's, China Foreign Ministry's Spokesperson. The attack on Ukraine is expected to trigger a new wave of migrations from Ukraine. Many Afghans left the country for Ukraine following the fall of the former government and are living in an uncertain fate.

Zhang said China is deeply concerned about the latest developments of the situation in Ukraine. Currently, it has come to a point which China does not want to see, he noted. China always forms its own position based on the merits of the matter at hand, the envoy said, adding that China advocates that all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected, and that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld. \"We have always called upon all parties to seek reasonable solutions to address each others concerns through peaceful means on the basis of equality and mutual respect. We welcome and encourage all efforts for a diplomatic solution, and support the Russian Federation and Ukraine in resolving the issue through negotiations,\" said Zhang. Zhang pointed out that in the past week, the Security Council has held two emergency meetings, and parties have fully elaborated on their positions and concerns on the current situation. \"At present, faced with the very complex and sensitive situation, the Security Council should make a necessary response. At the same time, such a response should also be extremely cautious,\" the ambassador added. If the Ukraine issue cannot be solved in a proper way, Zhang said, \"it may completely shut the door to a peaceful solution, and eventually it is the vast number of innocent people that will be the victims.\" \"We must draw profound lessons from the extremely painful experience in the past. For this reason, China abstained in the voting just now,\" he added. Zhang stressed that the Ukraine issue is not something that only emerged today, nor did the current situation occur suddenly overnight. It is a result of the interplay of various factors over a long period of time. \"China advocates the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,\" he said, adding that one country's security cannot be at the expense of the security of others, and that regional security should not rely on muscling up or even expanding military blocs. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be respected. Against the backdrop of five successive rounds of the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Russia's legitimate security demands should be given attention to and properly addressed, Zhang said.

Lynch may not have directed a full-length project since the 2017 limited series 'Twin Peaks: The Return' but he is connected to fans through his David Lynch Theater video project on YouTube. The filmmaker told Putin it's inevitable that \"death and destruction\" will come for him because \"what you sow you shall reap\". Reflecting upon human nature, he said in the video accessed by 'Variety', \"Mr. Putin, we are as human beings charged as to how we treat our fellow man. And there is a law of nature, a hard and fast law for which there are no loopholes and no escaping it, and this law is what you sow you shall reap.\" He then switched his tone to a more direct one as he further said in the video, \"And right now Mr. Putin you are sowing death and destruction. It's all on you. The Ukrainians didn't attack your country. You went in and attacked their country. All this death and destruction is going to come back and visit you, and in this big picture we are involved in, there is an infinite amount of time, life after life after life, for you to reap what you are sowing.\" He then goes on to give a word of advice to the Russian president, \"My advice to you is save yourself, save the Ukrainians, save this world. Start getting along with your neighbours. Start building friendships. We are a world family. There is no room for this kind of absurdity anymore.\" Urging Putin to cease the attack and military operations, he said, \"Get with it. Stop this attack.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi made\u00a0his comments during a phone call with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang said \u201cChina doesn\u2019t support the use of sanctions to solve problems, and even more so opposes unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been long proven that sanctions not only fail to solve [existing] problems, but create news ones, resulting \u2018lose-lose\u2019 effects on the economy and interfering in the process of political settlement,\u201d he added. The minister said China opposes both the use of force and sanctions regarding Ukraine. He argued that Russia\u2019s \u201clegitimate security demands\u201d on NATO\u2019s eastward expansion \u201cshould be properly addressed.\u201d Moscow said it seeks legally binding assurances that NATO will never accept Ukraine as a member state and will pull its troops from Eastern Europe \u2013 demands that the US-led bloc rejects.

Russia argued that the move was necessary to defend the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which broke off from Ukraine after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Ukraine said the attack by Russia was entirely unprovoked. Russia vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution condemning its operation in Ukraine on Friday, while China abstained from voting. According to Berlin, during her phone call with Wang, Baerbock \u201cstressed that China bears a special responsibility\u201d for the events in Ukraine as a permanent member of the UN\u2019s top decision-making body.",

The Embassy of Ukraine in Japan says it has been attempting to correct the misleading narrative, but the fake story has spread so rapidly it\u2019s now become impossible for them to rectify. Thankfully, people who know the truth online are continuing to make the real story known, including news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), who ran a story on the truth behind the photo on their digital verification site, AFP Fact Check. Is this a photo of Japan's ambassador staying to fight in Ukraine?No, this is Ukraine's ambassador to Japan posing prior to Russia's invasion of his country https://t.co/imCWVemJM6 pic.twitter.com/ZSL18h9sUJ\u2014 AFP Fact Check (@AFPFactCheck) February 25, 2022 So next time somebody tells you about the mysterious Japanese ambassador in Ukraine fighting with his great grandfather\u2019s samurai armour, you might want to ask them to check their sources. And then tell them the truth about the Ukrainian ambassador in Japan, who dressed in samurai armour as a show of strength against Putin and the impending invasion. Because that story is equally compelling, and best of all, true. Sources: Twitter/@KorsunskySergiy, Twitter/@kamuitetsuro, Twitter/@visegrad24 via AFP Fact Check, Yahoo!

The country has come under intense gunfire and bombing since Thursday, with citizens fleeing to safety.\u00a0 Overnight, airfields and gas pipelines appear to have been hit as the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0confirmed that missiles also hit a radioactive waste disposal site near Kyiv. On Facebook, it said: \u2018As of 27 February 2022 at 01:20 Kyiv time, as a result of the mass bombing of Kyiv with all types of anti-aircraft and missile weapons available to the Russian Federation, the missiles hit the radioactive waste disposal site of the Kyiv branch of the State Specialised Enterprise \u201cRadon\u201d. \u2018Notification was announced by telephone by radon personnel, who are in the shelter. \u2018As a result of the mass shooting, which is still ongoing it is currently not possible to assess the extent of the destruction.\u2019 The inspectorate stressed that there is no threat of radiation from people outside of the protection zone that surrounds the site, and confirmed that the situation will be assessed when there is a break in the bombing.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: The prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies somewhat stabilised on Saturday amid possible Russia-Ukraine talks.Bitcoin, which nosedived below $34,000 when the war began on Thursday, was flat on Saturday at nearly $39,000 per coin, compared with a 5 per cent gain in XRP digital asset and a 10 per cent rise in Terra's LUNA token, reports CoinDesk. The second major cryptocurrency Ethereum was at $2,710 per coin, up 2.66 per cent. \"Some investors expect the rebound in crypto prices to continue because of the spike in volatility,\" said the report. Some traders, however, expected the price bounce to be short-lived amid geopolitical uncertainty. Similar to volatility, Bitcoin's trading volume across major exchanges reached the highest level since the December 5 price crash, according to CoinDesk data. \"Consumer volumes on the exchange remain tepid despite large moves in the crypto space, suggesting reduced risk appetite and light overall positioning in markets,\" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in an email to clients on Friday. Earlier, the global crypto market lost nearly 10 per cent of its value as Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday. Over $200 billion worth of its global market value was wiped out. The most-hit cryptocurrencies were Ethereum, Cardano, Avalanche and Polkadot, along with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

        "description": "The present Ukraine-Russia crisis was dominating Geo Politics for last three months and has now taken the form of a war",
        "content": "Ukraine crisis The present Ukraine-Russia crisis was dominating Geo Politics for last three months and has now taken the form of a war, bringing the world to brink of World War 3. If we analyse why Ukraine is important or why Ukraine matters, then we shall find that Ukraine is very rich in mineral resources, apart from being one of the biggest countries in Europe on territorial basis with 41 million highly-educated people strongly motivated to work. Ukraine ranks first in Europe in recoverable reserves of Uranium ore, 2nd in Europe and 10th worldwide in Titanium ore reserves. Like the aforementioned materials, the East European country is rich in manganese ore and iron ore (2nd in the world), mercury ores, shale gas reserves and coal. On the agricultural front, Ukraine is an agricultural country. It ranks first in Europe in terms of arable land, 3rd in the world by the area of black soil. Ukraine is also producer of wheat (known as wheat basket of the world, 8th in wheat exports in the world), sunflower and sunflower oil, barley, chicken eggs, cheese, corn, potatoes, rye products, bee products etc. Ukraine is also highly industrialized. It is 2nd in Europe and 4th in the world in natural gas pipeline system, 3rd in Europe and 8th in the world in installed nuclear power plants capacity. Apart from these, Ukraine is a major producer of locators and location equipment, turbines, rocket launchers, clay exports, Defence products and steel. That is Ukraine and Putin's passion. Vladimir Putin played a smart game by fuelling civil protests in the region of Donetsk People's Republic and Luthansk People's Republic. Huge demand escalated in these two places, especially in Donbas, to join Russia by breaking away from Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government made the biggest mistake by using force against peaceful protestors and they fell into Putin's gameplan. Criticizing the 'Suppression of Citizens' Freedom', he struck unexpectedly and annexed Crimea. Do we realise why PM Modi did not use force against the so-called 'Farmers Protest'? He did not want to see Punjab turned into battlefield and draw the attention of the world. The whole 'Farmers Protests' was sponsored by ISI, Khalistanis and other anti-national forces. Coming back to Ukraine, US, NATO and EU staged strong protests against annexation of Crimea. Sanctions were imposed on Russia but Putin did not budge. Instead, he intensified the civil protests in Donetsk and Luthansk. Ukraine wanted to become member of NATO and Putin used his exact reason to mount military pressure, saying NATO accepting Ukraine as its member will endanger its security and sovereignty and it got US and NATO into panic mode. Hectic parleys between US plus NATO and Russia started, some fissures appeared as Germany and France took a stand against NATO. All said and done, we can conclude that the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurred due to inefficient leadership of USA. Secondly, India under PM Narendra Modi is playing a smart game in this hour of crisis. Finally, let us hope and pray the war ends and issues are solved through diplomatic talks. Julie Bhuyan, Gaurisagar. A villainous characterA CBI court in Ranchi on Monday (21.02.2022) sentenced RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment and also slapped a fine of Rs 60 lakh in the fifth and last fodder scam. The court also sentenced 39 others to rigorous imprisonment varying from 3 to 5 years with a total fine of Rs 11.93 crore (approx). Lalu Yadav was the Chief Minister of united Bihar from 1990 to July, 1997 when he was forced to resign as he had already been indicted in five fodder scams in 1996 related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from Deogarh, Chaibasha, Dumka and Doranda treasuries involving over a total of Rs 224.48 crore (approx). Earlier, in four other fodder scam cases he got a total jail term of 14 years and slapped penalty of Rs 60 lakh. Aside from this, Lalu Yadav, his wife and two MLA sons and one daughter, a Rajya Sabha MP, are facing probe agencies over multiple scams, including disproportionate assets and tax evasion cases; which are Indian Railway tender scam booked by CBI in 2005, Delight Properties benami Rs 45 crore booked by ED 2017, AB Exports benami assets Rs 40 crore booked by ED 2017 and Patna Zoo soil scam related to alleged purchase of soil worth more than Rs 90 lakh from a firm associated with his son Tej Pratap leaked in 2017 being probed by State Vigilance Bureau. It has to be pointed out that he had remained the de facto Chief Minister of the State from July 1997 to 2005 after awkwardly nominating his wife, a simple illiterate homemaker, to the post. His crime records revealed that he got multiple prison terms from 1985 to 2018. The above revelations read like an ignominious record of a crime lord. Basically being a villainous character, and unstinted support he received over these years from a syndicate, as it were, of the pariwar-vadi parties, Lalu Yadav felt no qualms to yield to immorality and betrayal of public trust. In the garb of a politician, Lalu Yadav has been dominating the national politics in general and the State of Bihar in particular for nearly 45 years. He was elected a Member of Lok Sabha in 1977; became the Railways Minister in the UPA Government, 2004-09. Despite his long record of corruptions and scandals involving his family as well, Lalu Yadav manipulated politics in his favour and stayed in the corridor of power. Besides, a media lobby, both print and electronic, has hugely touted his political career as a fire-brand secular leader; while continuous adulation and sympathy poured on him by the secular cabal. Last but not the least, reservation system and politics has catapulted him to the overnight fame. Criminalization of politics is a major issue of concern in the Indian politics. The misuse and abuse of political power for personal gains by the corrupt politicians has greatly dented development of India. A comprehensive amendment of the Representation of the People Act is urgently needed to shun nexus between crime and politics as also protect security and integrity of the country.

        "description": "One of my friends asked \u2018if the Russian invasion of Ukraine does not lead to World War 3",
        "content": "Kaustov Kashyap(pragatigroup08@gmail.com)One of my friends asked 'if the Russian invasion of Ukraine does not lead to World War 3, will this result in some country's opportunity for annexing or invading other countries? For example, can China annexe Taiwan? Will China attack India because Russia is on its side? Is it an opportunity for India to get back POK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir)? Is this Russia-Ukraine conflict having any message for the rest of the World? I will try to answer those questions. Yes, China can easily invade Taiwan and annex it in a couple of day's military operation. However, China has to estimate its probable economic loss because of various sanctions to be imposed upon it. But then China is a super-power militarily and thus no World power will intervene in that matter militarily. Regarding China attacking India or India attacking Pakistan to take back POK, we must understand the present-day warfare. No full-scale war can happen between two countries or two military alliances if both have the capacity to retaliate. If China attacks India, then India has the retaliatory capability and it can hit hard deep inside China. So, China won't dare a full-scale military attack although border skirmish will always be there. Similarly, Pakistan although militarily can't match India, yet has the capacity to retaliate. Most of Western and Northern India can be attacked by Pakistan military retaliation. In the long run, Pakistan may lose the battle against India but it can inflict irreparable loss and fatality to India. Thus, India shouldn't go for retaking POK unless it is compelled by any Pakistani act that amounts to danger for India's national security. The border skirmishes, limited war or even surgical type of proactive operations can be done post any terror attacks, but both countries will avoid a full-scale war. It's not only applicable for Indo-China or Indo-Pak situations. This is applicable to every country in the World. Let me give a couple of examples. Iran is not attacked by America or its allies just because Iran has the capacity to retaliate. It can go on bombing Saudi Arabia and its allies with large-scale destruction. Israel is surrounded by enemy countries yet it's safe because of its retaliatory capacity. America and NATO couldn't confront Russia militarily just because of its retaliatory activities. Forget about all other countries, even America couldn't dare to attack, North Korea because North Korea's retaliation would have a destructive effect on Japan and South Korea. The bottom line is that countries having a retaliatory capacity won't be bullied by more powerful countries militarily. Yes, there could be economical sanctions that could weaken a country despite having a retaliatory capacity. The above brings some lessons for the rest of the world, especially in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Firstly, sovereignty and freedom is the fundamental right of every nation. Also, all should be desirably peace-loving. But then if you don't have enough retaliatory power, then try to cohabit in a friendly atmosphere along with your neighbours. Never ever be a pawn of another powerful country. Ukraine and Georgia are the best examples. Just build your retaliatory military power without threatening your powerful neighbour. Secondly, no country is going to help you militarily when you are at war with another country. Despite all solidarity of the west and America, Ukraine is being decimated at the moment. So be prepared if you have a rough neighbouring country because, in case of war, it's your country alone that will fight alone. For example, if China attacks India, then it's India that will counter the attack alone. Neither America nor NATO nor even a long-standing ally like Russia will fight your war. This example applies to the Whole World. Thirdly, militarily inferior countries despite their economic condition must learn to exhibit 'neutrality'. Just following superpowers sycophantically, may bring danger in the future. Further, superpowers may compete economically but should avoid military conflicts directly or indirectly. In the Ukraine crisis, it's US and NATO who indulged in an indirect military conflict with Russia and Ukraine foolishly fell into the trap. Finally, I would say that War is devastating. But a World War in the present scenario would result in a crisis of human survival.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that he has spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Russia's aggression and sought \"political support\" at the United Nations Security Council.He revealed speaking to Modi soon after Russia praised India's decision to abstain from a vote at the United Nations to condemn its invasion. Zelensky said that he spoke with Modi and was informed of the course of Ukraine repulsing Russian aggression. He tweeted: \"More than 100,000 invaders are on our land. They insidiously fire on residential buildings.\" He urged India to give Ukraine political support in the United Nations Security Council. \"Stop the aggressor together!\" he said. India had abstained from voting on the UNSC resolution that deplores in the strongest terms Russia's aggression against Ukraine, saying dialogue is the only answer to settling differences and disputes. The Russian Embassy in India on Saturday said in a tweet, \"Highly appreciate India's independent and balanced position at the voting in the UNSC on February 25, 2022.\" It further stated, \"In the spirit of the special and privileged strategic partnership Russia is committed to maintaining close dialogue with India on the situation around Ukraine.\" The UNSC voted on the draft resolution presented by the US and Albania and co-sponsored by several other nations, including Australia, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom. While Russia, which chaired the meeting of the UNSC since it holds the presidency for February, vetoed the resolution, China and the UAE abstained along with India.

Around 100 students from Assam are studying in various universities in Ukraine. After the Russian airstrikes on Ukraine, evacuation of the stranded students is urgent. The Chief Minister said, \"Union Minister S Jaishankar informed me that the Ministry of External Affairs is working closely with the Indian Embassy in Ukraine for the expeditious evacuation of students and residents, including those from Assam, stranded in that country. I wish to reassure all parents to have faith in the Government of India.\" The Chief Minister has been taking up the issue of the stranded students in Ukraine from the first day of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine. Some of the students from Assam have already returned to the state. Five students \u2014 Sakbir Hoque, Chiranjit Dutta, Harbi Dutta, Daisy Medhi and Sneha Adhyapok \u2014 arrived at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport here on February 24. Harbi Dutta, a Terbopil National Medical University student in Ukraine, said, \"The situation was normal in the area where I lived. Following a blast near our university, all offline classes have stopped. The university authorities advised all students to be ready with essential documents to move to the basement floor in case of an emergency. The university has commenced classes online. So, there is not much to worry about. \"Fifty-sixty students from Assam are still stranded in the university following the cancellation of flights.\" A Correspondent from Nagaon adds: Two medical students from Nagaon town are currently stranded inside their houses in Ukraine's capital Kyiv after Russian armies attacked the country. The duo and eight other medical students from Assam are waiting for help from the Government of India. DHUBRI: A medical student, Ashique Hussain Sarkar of Hazarijharna village under Gauripur Police Station of the Dhubri district, is stranded in Ukraine. Ashique is the son of retired BSF Jawan Noor Mahammad Sarkar. He is a student of Sumi State University in Ukraine for a six-year- medical course. \"Though the External Affairs Minister of India arranged the safe evacuation of students studying in the Southern part of Ukraine, no move has been taken to rescue the students studying in the northern part, including Sumi State University. We are worried about the wellbeing of my son and others with him,\" Noor Mahammad Sarkar said. Also Read:\u00a0 Don't know how much longer my country will exist: Ukraine President Also watch:",

        "content": "STAFF REPORTERGUWAHATI: The Guwahati Tea Auction Buyers' Association (GTABA) has expressed the apprehension that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict may ultimately result in a further fall in prices of Indian tea. According to GTABA secretary Dinesh Bihani, Russia is the largest export destination for Indian tea, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries are also fond of Indian tea. \"If we lose this market, then the prices of Indian teas will further fall as there is a surplus of tea in the domestic market,\" he said. He informed via a press release that India's tea exports to the CIS countries stood at 40.17 million kg (mkg), valued at around Rs 744 crore, between January and November last year, as per statistics available on the website of the Tea Board of India. Out of this, exports to the Russian Federation stood at 30.89 mkg, estimated at Rs 558 crore. It accounts for nearly 77 per cent of the total exports to the CIS. The total export to Ukraine during this period was at 1.6 mkg (valued at around Rs 30 crore); Kazakhstan 6.25 mkg (Rs127 crore), while exports to other CIS countries stood at 1.43 mkg (Rs 29 crore). Exports during the same period in 2020 stood at 46.39 mkg, valued at around Rs 823 crore. Bihani said that India's tea exports during the calendar year 2021 were adversely impacted due to the lack of clarity overpayment mechanism with Iran and the higher prices of Indian CTC (crush-tear-curl) tea compared to the Kenyan counterpart. While actual figures are still not available, estimates suggest that tea exports from India are likely to be lower by around 12-13 per cent (close to 180 million mkg) during the calendar year 2021, against 207.58 mkg in 2020. If the Russia-Ukraine war goes on for a long time and more sanctions are imposed by NATO countries, then it will be very difficult for the tea sector in India, he said.

        "description": "Tuchel's Chelsea meet Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday.",
        "content": "Chelsea will make their first appearance since Russia invaded Ukraine (Picture: Getty) Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel says he would be \u2018happy\u2019 to lose the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool if it helped Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion. Chelsea, who are owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, will make their first outing since Russia declared war on Ukraine against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool on Sunday. Around 90,000 fans are expected at Wembley, while millions around the world will be watching on as Chelsea and Liverpool battle for the first domestic trophy of the season. But the importance of the fixture pales into insignificance when one considers events in eastern Europe over the past week, with Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring war on Ukraine. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Tuchel admits Chelsea\u2019s Carabao Cup final preparations have been affected by the situation in Ukraine and insists he has mixed feelings going into the Wembley final. The Blues boss said: \u2018Clearly [the match will act as a distraction], but still, because the war is so close, so fresh, maybe it comes with a little bit of a bad conscience on Sunday. \u2018Like, are we allowed to fully engage, fully celebrate? Or would it be inappropriate? This is how I feel about it because it\u2019s so new and fresh. It\u2019s a mixed feeling I have to say.\u2019 Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea meet Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool at Wembley (Picture: Getty) Tuchel, who led Chelsea to Champions League glory last season, also rejected the notion that his team could use any critical voices towards the club as extra motivation against Liverpool. Chelsea have faced criticism this week as their billionaire owner Abramovich is believed to be close with Mr Putin and is yet to comment on Russia\u2019s invasion. Tuchel added: \u2018I know what you mean and sometimes we use these things, like when a decision goes against you or you feel treated unfairly, to build this sort of mentality to protect you, your team, your staff and build a strong crew to shield yourself from the influences and unfairness from outside. \u2018In this case, the issue is too big. Chelsea owner and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich (Picture: Getty) \u2018I see the point but if you give it a second thought, how does it help now if we lose a football match given the situation that we have a war? \u2018This is simply not important enough and it will unfortunately not help. If it would, I am happy to lose the match.\u2019 Chelsea\u2019s preparations for the showpiece event at Wembley were overshadowed on Saturday by Roman Abramovich\u2019s decision to step back from operations and hand over stewardship of the club to trustees. Liverpool, meanwhile, will allow their star players to show solidarity with Ukraine before the match, after Saturday\u2019s Premier League fixtures saw a number of gestures and messages to the nation.

There\u2019s going to be a recession for the next I don\u2019t know how many years. It\u2019s going to hurt everyone and we\u2019re going to pay for that. Not the oligarchs, not the politicians.

It comes after he spoke to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone to discuss the international community\u2019s next steps. Downing Street said the prime minister \u2018paid tribute to the incredible heroism and bravery\u2019 of the Ukrainian people and its leader, who have put up a fierce fight since Moscow\u2019s invasion three days ago. A spokeswoman for the PM said the two leaders \u2018agreed that President Putin is being met with a greater Ukrainian resistance than he calculated on\u2019. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live The pair were also said to have \u2018agreed on the need for the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially\u2019 \u2013 including banning it from Swift. Swift is an international payments system that some countries \u2013 including the UK \u2013 want to freeze Russia out of. However, some European nations haven\u2019t been willing to agree to this because it would hurt companies that supply goods to and buy from Russia. But Germany \u2013 a key hold-out \u2013 considerably softened its position earlier today after several other EU members said they would back the ban, including Italy and France. In a statement, No 10 said: \u2018The Prime Minister spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy this evening. \u2018He paid tribute to the incredible heroism and bravery of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people. \u2018The leaders agreed that President Putin is being met with a greater Ukrainian resistance than he calculated on. \u2018The Prime Minister updated on the UK\u2019s support to Ukraine and the progress rallying international partners to hold Russia to account for their campaign of destruction. \u2018The leaders agreed on the need for the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially. They welcomed the increased willingness to take action on excluding Russia from SWIFT.\u2019 The spokeswoman also said Mr Johnson and Zelensky \u2018expressed their mutual concern about the role Belarus is playing as a conduit for President Putin\u2019s violence\u2019. After the call, Zelensky tweeted his thanks to the UK and said he had agreed \u2018the next steps\u2019 to tackle Russia\u2019s aggression with Britain. \u2018Grateful to the British Prime Minister for his position, new decisions to enhance the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian army. Agreed on further joint steps to counter the aggressor,\u2019 Mr Zelensky said. Countries around the world are ramping up their support for Ukraine as it braces for a fourth night of air strikes. Germany, France and the Netherlands all announced new shipments of weapons on Saturday. Britain has already pledged to continue to supply arms to Ukraine\u2019s embattled forces. So far 2,000 anti-tank missile launchers have already been sent and armed forces minister James Heappey said the Ministry of Defence is working on plans to support a resistance movement and a government in exile if Ukraine was finally overran. Western intelligence officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and install his own puppet leadership in a bid to wind back the clock to the Soviet era. Yesterday, Boris Johnson accused the Russian leader of being a bent on a \u2018revanchist mission to overturn the post-Cold War order\u2019. He made the comments as he joined the US and EU in ordering personal sanctions against against Putin and and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

Charity industry experts say Canadians have a variety of options of where to give, from registered charities and nonprofits to crowdfunding for grassroots projects and individual families. Bruce MacDonald, president and CEO of Imagine Canada, says the crisis is bringing out the generosity of Canadians, but a little research will help them pick a charity that aligns with their passions and ensure their \u201ctrust barometer\u201d feels good.

The federal government announced Friday it would match individual donations to the Canadian Red Cross up to $10 million to help bring humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively committed to matching donations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees up to $1 million.

European countries will have to look for other suppliers to meet 30 per cent of their energy needs which emanate from Russia. As part of the new sanctions, Germany has already blocked certification of the Nordstream 2 pipeline that was meant to augment gas supplies directly from Russia, instead of going via Ukraine. Like the rest of the world, the Indian economy will face the fall-out of these geopolitical tensions. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has already warned that it could take a toll on the country's financial stability and that the situation especially crude oil prices is being monitored closely. The psychological 100 dollars per barrel mark was crossed as soon as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that a military operation would be taking place in the Ukraine. In this backdrop, it is clear that the forecast of 125 dollars per barrel over the next few months is a likely scenario. Hopefully, it will remain below the highest ever level of 147 dollars reached in 2008. The net result of higher prices is that budgetary estimates which were based on an average price of 70 to 75 dollars per barrel during 2022-23 will have to be completely reworked. The oil import bill which is estimated to be around 110 billion dollars in the current fiscal, will rise significantly next year. The higher burden on the exchequer will mean that the current pause in raising retail prices of petroleum products will end and pump prices are bound to go up. The pause over the last three months has evidently been linked to electioneering in key states including UP. Though technically the oil marketing companies are free to raise prices in tandem with international rates, effectively these public enterprises wait for clearance from the administrative Petroleum Ministry. With the existing level of retail prices linked to global prices of about 82 to 83 dollars per barrel, it seems inevitable that a price hike is on the cards as soon as state election results are out. The option of cutting the high excise duties on petroleum products, could certainly be resorted to in order to prevent a high burden on consumers. But with the prospect of a growing oil import bill, it will have to be seen whether the exchequer can bear the loss. Last year's excise duty cut on petrol and diesel cost Rs. 60000 crore. Revenues have been buoyant in 2021-22, but expenditure commitments especially for infrastructure projects are also higher than usual so this would be a tough call. With higher fuel prices on the anvil, inflationary pressures on the economy will mount further. This could push the central bank into raising interest rates earlier than expected. Inflation was reported to be about 6 per cent in January this year, higher than the 5.66 per cent recorded in December 2021. This is also on the higher side of the inflation band of 4 to 6 per cent set by the Reserve Bank of India. In case this is breached soon, the RBI may put its focus back on inflation rather than on growth and raise rates like many other central banks around the world. With the Ukraine crisis leading to higher outflow of foreign exchange due to more expensive oil purchases, there could also be pressure on the rupee, which has already begun to depreciate to some extent. Apart from oil, however, other commodities especially metals may show a surge in international markets. As Russia is a major producer of aluminium and nickel, both metals are already ruling at multi- year highs. This is significant for industrial consumers here as India has become a major buyer of aluminium scrap even though it has enough of the metal to meet domestic demand. Nickel which is a key requirement in many industries has also become a high priced commodity. Other metals where Russia is a major supplier include platinum and palladium. It is the largest producer of palladium and the second largest for platinum. Both these precious metals are used, apart from jewellery, for critical manufacturing purposes. Palladium especially has gained in value in recent years, owing to use in catalytic convertors for automobiles. Prices of both these metals are now rising rapidly in world markets. There is no doubt, therefore, that the geopolitical tensions over Ukraine and the launch of sanctions against Russia on this account will have widespread ramifications for the global economy. Stock markets are already exhibiting volatility in many countries. In India, for instance, the stock markets have been on a roller-coaster ride ever since the crisis erupted owing the likely impact on the country's economic revival. Foreign institutional investors have already been withdrawing from Indian markets over the past few months owing to the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates and tighten the easy money policy of the pandemic period. This was expected to be a short term phenomenon but with the Ukraine situation having deteriorated, it may be for a longer period. With the third wave of the pandemic only receding now, the government sought to shore up the fragile recovery in its latest budget by putting the focus on infrastructure spending. The geopolitical tensions in distant Ukraine, however, are likely to disrupt plans to achieve 8 per cent growth in the next fiscal. The government has no option but to immediately review the economic scenario to meet the new challenges and revise its strategies for the near and medium term.",

The number of people detained, reported by AFP, is as of Thursday, the second day of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Protests against the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued into Saturday evening for the third straight day, despite many arrests. Images emerged of police officers detaining protesters in St Petersburg, both men and women. Police in St Petersburg took away a young woman carrying a black bag with the words, \u2018No war\u2019, according to the news site SotaVision. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live A group of anonymous St Petersburg protesters wore skull masks and hoodies at a cemetery, raising placards with the messages, \u2018Don\u2019t they have enough bodies\u2019, and \u2018There are no patriots among the dead\u2019, news site Vot Tak reported. In Moscow, artist Anzhela Aganina wore a traditional Ukrainian shirt and lay severed blonde braids and flowers at her feet, according to SotaVision. In Yekaterinburg, hundreds of Russians marched and chanted \u2018No to war!\u2019 the Telegram channel Avtozak Live reported. Saturday\u2019s figure grew from Friday, when the Associated Press reported that about 1,745 people were detained across 54 cities in Russia, with at least 957 in Moscow. On Saturday alone, more than 325 protesters were detained across 30 Russian cities and towns, with nearly half of them in Moscow, according to OVD-Info, an independent Russian human rights group tracking arrests in opposition rallies.

        "content": "LETHBRIDGE, AB \u2013 Well over 100 people turned up outside of Lethbridge City Hall on Saturday to show their support for the people of Ukraine. Many brought Ukrainian flags with them and sang songs. Others carried signs with messages including \u201cPutin\u2019s eh war criminal,\u201d \u201cStand with Ukraine,\u201d \u201cStop the War,\u201d and \u201cPray for Ukraine.\u201d Misha Pereverza was the lead organizer of the rally. He spoke to media about 15 minutes after the gathering started and said the turnout was already more than he expected. Earlier this week, his wife received a call from their family in Ukraine informing them of the developing situation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to just sit and, you know, it just was something internal inside me told me\u2026 I have to do something. I understand that I wasn\u2019t able to do too much, but still, this is very small thing we can do here. Unfortunately, this is very small, but we will try to do our best here.\u201d His family overseas includes his wife\u2019s parents, two brothers, and six sisters. Like many of the attendees at the rally, Pereverza says he is worried about his family\u2019s safety. \u201cThis is huge family and they are under the bombing right now, so they just sit in the basement. It\u2019s terrible. I just cannot imagine anybody \u2013 you\u2019ll sit in the basement and think that maybe some bombs will fly to your house.\u201d Devon Hargreaves also helped to organize the rally, and like Pereverza, has family in Ukraine. A friend of his was showing him photos of people they knew in Ukraine who had been conscripted into Ukraine\u2019s army and are now part of the war effort. \u201cBy holding rallies like we are today and showing a strong support of solidarity, it\u2019s supporting what are the steps our government has taken to sanction Russia and Putin. I hope that it gets back to our family and friends in the Ukraine and sends a strong message that the rest of the world is watching. We are there and we do support them.\u201d According to the 2016 federal census, Alberta was home to 369,090 people of Ukrainian descent, including 6,550 people who lived in Lethbridge.

        "content": "(NEXSTAR) \u2013 Officials in Ukraine say measurements at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster have shown increased radiation levels after Russian troops took control of the former nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Friday that Ukrainian officials believe the increased radiation may have been caused by military activity or vehicles \"stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 incident.\" The IAEA added that the readings, while elevated, still remain \"within the operational range.\" \"The IAEA assesses that the readings reported by the regulator \u2014 of up to 9,46 microSieverts per hour \u2014 are low and remain within the operational range measured in the Exclusion Zone since it was established, and therefore do not pose any danger to the public,\" the agency wrote Friday. The IAEA's main concern, however, is the continued and safe operation of Ukraine's nuclear facilities amid an attack by Russian military forces. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi added that it was of \"vital importance\" that the country's plants not be disturbed, according to Friday's news release. Ukraine invasion: Poland expects up to 1M refugees Ukraine's State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) first relayed news of Chernobyl's increased measurements earlier on Friday, after observing higher levels of gamma radiation \"at a significant number of observation points.\" At the time, the agency said it was \"impossible\" to determine the exact cause of the radiation because of Russia's military forces. In response to SNRI, nuclear watchdog group CRIIRAD, based in France, quickly issued a statement warning that Chernobyl contained several sites which were \"reservoirs of radiation\" that could easily become more problematic if hit by mortars or shells, or if fires broke out in the area. \"Everything must be done to keep their safety devices in operation,\" wrote CRIIRAD, which said it was also working to determine if the elevated levels could have been caused by electromagnetic activity or misrepresented due to cyberattacks. CRIIRAD also urged that respiratory protections \u2014 for any workers allowed to remain on the site \u2014 are imperative as the soil contains a \"cocktail\" of radioactive substances. Advocates fear fate of 100K orphaned kids in Ukraine As of Friday, the IAEA reported that Ukraine's nuclear reactors continue to operate safely, though Director General Grossi said he remains \"gravely concerned\" about the events unfolding in Ukraine.",

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and the conflict has already reached capital city Kyiv, with at least 198 civilians having died so far. The Premier League has several notable Ukrainians playing in the division, with national team captain and City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko going up against compatriot Vitaly Mykolenko at Goodison Park on Saturday. Zinchenko and Mykolenko shared a touching moment pre-game (Picture: AP) For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live As well as all the players showing solidarity with their teammates \u2013 and the people of Ukraine \u2013 Everton also ditched their usual pre-match Z-Cars air-raid siren due to the conflict in Ukraine and played The Hollies hit He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother instead. Zinchenko joined a vigil outside Manchester\u2019s Central Library on Thursday in support of his homeland, with the building lit up in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag. The 25-year-old has posted a host of messages on social media condemning Putin\u2019s actions and City offered to give him time off, but Zinchenko made himself available for selection. Everton and City\u2019s players both condemned Russia\u2019s invasion (Picture: Reuters) Everton played the song He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother pre-match (Reuters) Asked about the defender\u2019s state of mind, Manchester City boss Guardiola said: \u2018It\u2019s a worry, what we feel with our country where we were born. Killing innocent people, how would you feel? I guess that\u2019s how he feels. \u2018Of course it\u2019s close to him. Of course he has our support. It happened in the country he was born, the country he loves, it\u2019s attacked from outside. He\u2019s tough and knows we are here.\u2019 Mykolenko only moved to Merseyside in January from Dynamo Kyiv and Everton boss Frank Lampard spoke to the 22-year-old several times before deciding whether to select him against City, with the youngster \u2013 like Zinchenko \u2013 named on the bench. Both clubs have been keen to support their Ukrainian teammates (Picture: Getty) Everton fans produced a banner supporting Ukraine and Mykolenko (Picture: EPA) Speaking to Sky Sports shortly before kick-off, Lampard said: \u2018It\u2019s important to show our support. I think we have a lot of empathy at the club, it\u2019s a people\u2019s club, I think generally some of the support you\u2019ve seen in the sporting world has been fantastic. \u2018And when we have a player, as City do as well, with Vitaly for us, I had numerous conversations with him. The decision was always his to be involved or not, he\u2019s never given the inkling that he doesn\u2019t want to be involved. \u2018I think it\u2019s a small release for him at the moment to train with us and feel like he\u2019s part of our family.

Cash fired Steven Gerrard\u2019s Villa ahead on 17 minutes of Saturday\u2019s Premier League fixture against Brighton and proceeded to take off his shirt to reveal a top which read: \u2018Tomasz Kedziora and family \u2013 stay strong bro.\u2019 Kedziora plays for Poland and Dynamo Kviy in the Ukrainian Premier League and is still in the capital city as Russia\u2019s invasion of the country continues. After revealing the message of support, Polish international Cash was shown a yellow card by referee John Brooks. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Premier League rules say players cannot \u2018reveal undergarments that show political, religious, or personal slogans, statements, or images\u2019. But it is believed that Cash\u2019s top was not deemed political, with the Villa defender instead booked for removing his Aston Villa shirt, irrespective of the message written underneath. Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling said: \u2018It\u2019s a message for the people in Ukraine, and he\u2019s been booked for it! Cash scored in Villa\u2019s Premier League fixture against Brighton (Picture: Getty) \u2018For goodness sake, John Brooks is an inexperienced Premier League referee and hopefully when people come to their senses, the Premier League will just ignore that. They should just ignore that.\u2019 A number of Premier League clubs showed solidarity with Ukraine during Saturday\u2019s fixtures, with the Manchester United and Watford players displaying a banner at Old Trafford calling for peace. Everton and Manchester City also wore shirts in their warm-ups which displayed the words \u2018no war\u2019. The Polish FA confirmed on Saturday that they will boycott next month\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Poland were originally scheduled to travel to Moscow on March 24 for their World Cup qualification play-off match against Russia, with the winner then hosting either Sweden or Czech Republic for a place in next winter\u2019s tournament in Qatar. Polish international Tomasz Kedziora is still in Kyiv (Picture: Getty) A statement read: \u2018We, the players of the Polish national team, together with the Polish FA, decided that as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, we do not intend to play in the play-off match against Russia. \u2018It is not an easy decision, but there are more important things in life than football. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian nation and our friend from the national team, Tomasz Kedziora, who is still in Kyiv with his family.\u2019 Poland and Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski added: \u2018It is the right decision! I can\u2019t imagine playing a match with the Russian national team in a situation where armed aggression in Ukraine continues. \u2018Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can\u2019t pretend that nothing is happening.\u2019 More: Premier LeagueRoman Abramovich's daughter slams Vladimir Putin amid calls for Chelsea to be seizedPaul Merson makes Chelsea vs Liverpool Carabao Cup final prediction'It's madness' - Glen Johnson slams Chelsea decision over star duo For more stories like this, check our sport page.

        "content": "Arrigo Sacchi once called football the most important of the least important things, and Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) echoed that sentiment following his solo victory at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad on Saturday, as he expressed his solidarity with the people of Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s invasion of the country.After crossing the finish in Ninove, Van Aert sat for a flash interview with Sporza, where he discussed his remarkable solo victory, but before taking his leave, he recognised the relative insignificance of a bike race when war is being waged elsewhere on the continent.\u201cI want to say one more thing: bike racing is the most important side issue in the world, with the emphasis on \u2018side issue,\u2019\u201d Van Aert said.\u201cIt's just madness that a war is still possible today, and so close.

        "content": "MYKOLAIV, Ukraine (NewsNation Now) \u2014 Advocates of the more than 100,000 orphaned children in Ukraine are sounding the alarm. For more than 15 years, the Nevada-based group \"Abundance International\" has been a lifeline for two Ukrainian orphanages \u2014 providing money, medicine, manpower and equipment. The children in these orphanages are no older than 4. It's never been easy \u2014 but it's never been harder than now, the organization\u2019s founder and director, Mark Edward Daniels, said on \"Banfield\" Friday night. Ukraine invasion: Poland expects up to 1M refugees Daniels, who spoke from southern Ukraine, said the children don\u2019t realize they\u2019re in the middle of a war. \u201cFor them, it's more like a heavy storm of lightning and thunder,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAnd when they hear the noise, a comforting parent has to come along and just say, 'It's going be OK.'\" Davis said they are still able to get in contact with doctors, and their food supply should last them up to a month. But he\u2019s worried about what would happen if the Ukrainian government falls. \u201cMy biggest fear is \u2026 we build these ICU units, birthing centers, everything else we can to help these kids to have a good life. We only cover a portion of the funding. The government has always been the undercurrent,\u201d he said. In the event of a transitional government, Davis worries the children in his care will become bureaucratic casualties. \u201cIs it really a priority [for a new] government to keep writing the checks to these [organizations]? If it is a transitioning government? Has the new government already made this a priority to happen? Or is this going to get lost in the bureaucratic shell police departments?\u201d His operation is located on the southern border of Ukraine and not far from the eastern border where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for years. Davis said that while there has always been political rhetoric, he never thought it would come to an invasion. \u201cEvery Ukrainian has family and relatives in Russia and every Russian has family relatives here. We've seen this for eight years \u2026 the noise and the posturing and the political bantering, but nobody believed it would actually come to war,\u201d Davis said. https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ukraines-capital-survives-the-night-fierce-fight-continues/ In the event Russia does take control, Davis hopes President Vladimir Putin keeps vital infrastructure in place. \u201cThe banks are all up, the internet is all up, cell phone systems are still up,\u201d said Davis. \u201cSo we have hope and faith that Putin intends of keeping those up in order to reestablish normality as quickly as possible \u2014 if he is in charge.\u201d If Ukraine is able to hold the country, he\u2019s confident operations will return to normal.

        "description": "After a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country, Russian forces were closing in on Ukraine's capital of Kyiv on Saturday. City officials warned of street fighting and urged residents to stay inside and take cover.",
        "content": "VIENNA (AP) \u2014 After a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country, Russian forces were\u00a0closing in on Ukraine's capital\u00a0of Kyiv on Saturday. City officials warned of street fighting and urged residents to stay inside and take cover. Here are the things to know about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the security crisis in Eastern Europe: What is going on in Ukraine's capitol? Central Kyiv appeared quiet Saturday. Ukrainian officials reported some success in fending off Russian assaults, but fighting persisted near the capital. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. With growing signs that Russia aims to overthrow him and his government, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to \u201cstand firm.\u201d U.S. defense officials said they believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding more slowly than Moscow had envisioned, though that could change quickly. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko extended the city's curfew from 5 p.m. until 8 a.m. He said \u201call civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy\u2019s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.\u201d The Biden administration said it was sending Ukraine up to $350 million in arms and other defensive supplies from U.S. stockpiles with another $250 million in defensive support possible. The Czech Republic also approved a plan to send more arms to Ukraine. Where is Ukraine's president? Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, has been posting video messages of himself and other national leaders in Kyiv since the invasion began on Thursday but his exact whereabouts were not publicly known. Zelenskyy was urged early Saturday to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying \u201cthe fight is here\u201d and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but \u201cnot a ride.\u201d In his latest message on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Russian attempts to forge into Kyiv have been repelled and Moscow\u2019s plan to quickly seize the capital and install a puppet government has been thwarted. \u201cThe real fighting for Kyiv is ongoing,\u201d Zelenskyy said, accusing Russia in a video message of hitting infrastructure and civilian targets. \u201cWe will win.\u201d Since then, Zelenskyy has posted regular updates on his Twitter account about the various world leaders he has spoken with Saturday, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In Ukraine, Russian troops march on Kyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, who were trying to advance on the city from several directions. They advised residents to remain in shelters or, if home, to avoid going near windows or onto balconies. The Ukrainian military said a battle was underway near a military unit west of the city center. Mayor Klitschko said new explosions shook near a major power plant that the Russians were trying to attack. A missile slammed into a high-rise building on the southwestern outskirts of Kyiv, Klitschko said Saturday. He said rescue workers were there and posted an image showing a gaping hole on one side of the building. Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor and a Hall of Fame boxer, says he'll be 'fighting' in the streets if need be Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed Saturday that since the start of Russia\u2019s attack, its military had hit 821 Ukrainian military facilities, 87 tanks and other targets. Konashenkov didn\u2019t say how many Ukrainian troops were killed and didn\u2019t mention any casualties on the Russian side. Neither his claims nor Ukraine\u2019s allegations that its forces killed thousands of Russian troops could be independently verified. Konashenkov claimed the Russian military has taken full control of the southern city of Melitopol, 35 kilometers (22 miles) inland from the Azov Sea coast, and said Russia-backed separatists have made significant gains in the eastern region of Donbas. Ukrainian civilians in harm's way Russia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but civilians have been killed and injured during Europe\u2019s largest ground war since World War II. Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said Saturday that 198 people have been killed and more than 1,000 others have been wounded in the Russian offensive. It was not clear whether the figure included both military and civilians. He said 1,115 other people, including 33 children, were wounded in the Russian invasion. Some Ukrainians are fleeing for safety U.N. officials said\u00a0nearly 120,000 Ukrainians had left the country\u00a0for Poland, Moldova and other neighboring nations and the number was going up fast as Ukrainians grabbed their belongings and rushed to escape the deadly Russian onslaught. Miles-long lines of vehicles clogged border crossings, mostly carrying women, children and the elderly. Others came on trains or buses into Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. Authorities in these countries mobilized to receive the Ukrainians, providing shelter, food and legal help. They also eased their usual border procedures, including COVID-19 testing requirements. \u201cAlmost 116,000 have crossed international borders as of right now. This may go up, it\u2019s changing every minute,\u201d said Shabia Mantoo, the spokeswoman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s very fluid and changing by the hour.\u201d The agency expects up to 4 million Ukrainians could flee if the situation deteriorates. Protestors turn out across the globe to criticize Russia From Tokyo to London to Taipei, Ukrainians living abroad and hundreds of protesters around the world have turned out on the streets to show their support for Ukraine. Several hundred Ukrainians living in Japan gathered outside of Tokyo\u2019s main train stations Saturday, chanting \u201cStop war!\u201d and \u201cPeace for Ukraine.\u201d They held up signs including \u201cNo war,\u201d \u201cStop Putin, Stop Russia,\u201d while others waved Ukrainian flags. At a separate rally reportedly organized by Russian residents in Japan, several dozen people chanted \u201cHands off Ukraine!\u201d In Taiwan, demonstrators chanting \u201cStand with Ukraine\u201d and \u201cGlory to Ukraine\u201d protested outside the Russian representative office on Saturday. More than 200 Ukrainians gathered outside the Russian Embassy in an Athens suburb Saturday to protest the invasion, chanting slogans and holding posters with messages including \u201cRussia go home,\u201d \u201cPutin burn in hell,\" and \u201cWe need your help, world!!!\u201d Turning the sanctions screws on Russia The West has taken a military option in Ukraine off the table, but world leaders \u2014 with the exception of Moscow ally China \u2014 are preparing measures aimed at\u00a0hurting the Russian economy and its leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. The United States, Canada and European allies all announced they are adding direct measures against Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. EU ministers have said even further sanctions were still possible, including booting Russia out of SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions. What is the SWIFT banking system and why hasn\u2019t Russia been removed from it? Russia on Saturday warned it could react by opting out of its last remaining nuclear arms pact and cutting diplomatic ties. The deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said sanctions could offer Moscow a pretext for a review of its ties with the West, suggesting that Russia could cut them altogether. \u201cWe may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights,\u201d he said. He also suggested that Russia could opt out of the New START nuclear arms control treaty that limits U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. Asian and Pacific countries have joined the West in taking punitive measures against Russia, including export controls aimed at starving its industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products. Sporting world turns its back on Russia Poland is\u00a0refusing to play its World Cup qualifier against Russia\u00a0next month in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Polish soccer president said Saturday. The match had been scheduled for March 24. In addition, Russia has been stripped of hosting the May 28 Champions League final by UEFA with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris, and Formula One dropped this season\u2019s Russian Grand Prix in Sochi in September. The International Ski Federation announced Russia will not host any more of its World Cup events this winter, and the European curling championships scheduled to be held in November in Perm, Russia, will also be relocated. The International Tennis Federation also canceled all events in Russia indefinitely. Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wants the SpaceX CEO to provide Starlink stations Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov called on Saturday for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to \u201cprovide Ukraine with Starlink stations\u201d and use his public platform to encourage \u201csane Russians\u201d to oppose their government. \u201cWhile you try to colonize Mars \u2013 Russia try to occupy Ukraine!\u201d Fedorov wrote in a tweet to Musk. \u201cWhile your rockets successfully land from space \u2014 Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people!\u201d \u201cWe ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand,\u201d Fedorov\u2019s message concluded. Musk\u2019s Starlink project is an ambitious attempt to install a grid of satellites in the Earth\u2019s orbit to provide internet access across the globe. SpaceX has thus far put more than 1,700 Starlink satellites into orbit, and the company plans on launching more than 40,000 in total. However, while these satellites pass over Ukraine, there are no ground stations in the country to make use of the network. The nearest ground station is located in the Polish village of Wola Krobowska. Read more Meta sends message to \u2018ordinary Russians\u2019 Musk has thus far refrained from commenting on the conflict in Ukraine, nor given any indication that he would urge Russians to \u201cstand up\u201d to President Vladimir Putin. Despite being a prolific Twitter user, Musk has only mentioned Ukraine a handful of times, most recently in 2019 when he praised the \u201cmajor role\u201d Ukrainians played in the Soviet space program. With Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine ongoing and fighting reaching the outskirts of Kiev, Fedorov has called on the tech industry to get involved in the conflict. In a post to Facebook earlier on Saturday, he revealed that he had \u201casked YouTube to block the Russian propaganda media,\u201d and asked Meta and Netflix to withhold their services from Russia.\u00a0 Fedorov also called on Apple CEO Tim Cook to block access to the App Store from Russia. However, the Russian government has already restricted access to Facebook of its own accord after the company censored several Russian media outlets. Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine has resumed after Kiev rejected negotiations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday. The Russian advance had been halted since Friday as Russia waited for Ukraine to say whether it would talk, he added. Russia\u2019s aim in Ukraine is to carry out \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d of the country, and to force Kiev to commit to neutrality and drop its goal of joining the NATO alliance.",

        "content": "Blue and yellow were prominent colours outside the Legislative Building in Regina on Friday. Hundreds attended a rally to show support for Ukraine, with many waving Ukrainian flags. Chants calling for an end to the war and to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin rang out along with the Ukrainian national anthem. Rally organizer Anastasiia Sheichuk is from Ukraine. She came to Regina in 2019 to pursue a master\u2019s degree in public policy. She said she found out the news Russia had invaded her homeland on Wednesday night from her boyfriend, who also had family in Ukraine. \u201cHe said to me that Russia was bombing Ukraine and I was speechless. I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Sheichuk said. \u201cMy family and friends are in Ukraine right now. \u201cThey suffer tremendously, some of them waiting in the shelters. My parents sleep fully dressed and waiting for whatever will happen \u2014 whether there will be bombing or something.\u201d She said she remains in contact with her friends and family in Ukraine. Rally organizer Anastasiia Sheichuk speaks outside the Legislative Building on Feb. 25, 2022. (Britton Gray/980 CJME) \u201cMy parents went to check for the nearest shelters and everything because there was some information (the Russian forces) may be bombing the airport near there,\u201d Sheichuk said. Sheichuk said her body was trembling and shaking from what she was hearing. \u201cWhy should it be happening? For what reason? There\u2019s no excuse, no reason for this. This is the most brutal crime someone can do,\u201d Sheichuk said. She said the world needs to unite to fight back against the Russian invasion. \u201cWhat Putin did, it is not just an attack for Ukraine, this is an attack on the whole world. He disrespects everything and everyone and every international organization and agreement,\u201d Sheichuk said. \u201cThe whole world should unite to fight back and show that we are (standing) in solidarity and there is no tolerance for these actions in this world.\u201d She called on all countries to impose sanctions on Russian politicians and oligarchs and for courts to sentence Putin for war crimes against Ukraine. Vitaly Jaroshevsky and Vitaly Shevron were out with the red and white Belarus flag to show that other nationalities are standing with Ukraine. \u201cUnfortunately, the insane dictator of Belarus provided our beautiful Belorussian land to Putin to use for aggression and war against the people of Ukraine. It is a real tragedy for all of us and we can\u2019t just (stand and watch). That\u2019s why we are here today, to support our brothers and sisters in Ukraine and support our brothers and sisters here,\u201d Jaroshevsky said. \u201cWe believe that freedom will win.\u201d A Ukrainian priest speaks at the rally outside the Legislative Building in Regina on Feb. 25, 2022. (Britton Gray/980 CJME) \u201cThe government has to be vocal and tell the truth to Canadian people about what is really going on and what Putin is doing against the Ukrainian country. It must be transparent and must be brought to all of us and hopefully, the other Western world is going to be able to hear and see what is happening now. This guy leading Russia is a maniac,\u201d Shevrov added. \u201cNobody knows what he is doing next. Knowing that, we have to know that the Westerners could be next.\u201d Sheichuk said all Ukrainians are against Russia trying to take the country. \u201cWe are standing for a free Ukraine. We are a sovereign country and we have a choice to decide what we do. They are just there invading us, attacking us and just making the most horrible crimes,\u201d Sheichuk said. \u201cPeople like (Putin) don\u2019t stop. He wants power, he wants to do whatever he wants and he needs to be stopped.\u201d",

Cezary Kulesza made the announcement on Twitter and indicated Poland was in talks with other federations to present a unified position to FIFA, which is responsible for the March 24 game in Moscow. \u201cNo more words, time to act!\u201d Kulesza wrote, saying the move was prompted by the \u201cescalation of the aggression.\u201d Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, the nation\u2019s all-time leading scorer and winner of FIFA\u2019s best-player award for the past two years, immediately responded to say it\u2019s the \u201cright decision!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues,\u201d the Bayern Munich star said on Twitter. \u201cRussian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can\u2019t pretend that nothing is happening.\u201d FIFA has yet to take a clear position on Russia hosting or even playing against Poland. European soccer body UEFA said Friday that in its competitions all Russian and Ukrainian teams must now move their home games to play in other countries. Previously, Poland had only said it did not want to play the qualifying playoff semifinal in Moscow. The winner is due to host Sweden or the Czech Republic on March 29 for a place at the World Cup being played in Qatar from Nov. 21-Dec. 18. The head of Sweden\u2019s federation, Karl-Erik Nilsson, is also first vice president at UEFA which has stripped Russia of hosting the Champions League final in St. Petersburg in May. UEFA decided Friday to move that game to Paris. Russian troops pressed toward Ukraine\u2019s capital Saturday, after a night of explosions and street fighting that sent Kyiv residents seeking shelter underground. It was not immediately clear how far Russian troops had advanced. Ukrainian officials reported some success in fending off assaults, but fighting persisted near the capital.",

        "description": "Around 18,000 Indian students stranded in Ukraine were there to pursue medicine. PM Modi\u00a0has asked students to study in India. However, what is it that's taking\u00a0them to Ukraine for medical education?",
        "content": "Over the last few days, Indian social media has been flooded with accounts and images of young Indian students stranded in Ukraine, hiding out in bunkers and making desperate pleas for an evacuation from what is swiftly become a war-torn country, thanks to Russia's ongoing military action. Among these, a good number of students happen to be pursuing medicine in the Eastern European country. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing a webinar on the allocations for the health sector in the Union Budget said, \"Our children today are going to small countries for study, especially in medical education. Language is a problem there. They are still going...\" He went on to ask if the private sector couldn't capture this market in \"a big way\", and if the state governments couldn't frame good policies for land allotment, according to a report by PTI.\u00a0 A good number of the students currently stranded are pursuing medicine in Kharkiv and Kyiv.\u00a0Why then has\u00a0Ukraine emerged as a lucrative option for Indian medical aspirants and what are the factors driving them there? For starters, a medical degree in Ukraine takes the bite of competition out of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. All one has to do is qualify NEET to gain admission to a Ukrainian medical college. The cutthroat strife for the highest rank is all but eliminated. Then there's also the fact that medical education in Ukraine comes significantly cheaper than one in a private medical college in India. If a student lands a rank good enough to get a seat in a government college in India, they'll be charged around 2 lakh per annum to complete the four-year course, whereas private colleges can charge anywhere beyond four times that number. And once the MBBS degree is gained, students will have to battle it out again with the NEET PG exam for an MD, fees for which can be even higher. On the other hand, according to The MDHouse, (who are they?) which has been partnering with a premier state university for medicine in Ukraine for India, to gain an MBBS+MD qualification in Ukraine over six years would cost students just about 16 lakh rupees in fees. Apart from being light on the pocket, universities in Ukraine are also bestowed with good infrastructure to teach medicine. Add to that the fact that medical degrees earned in Ukraine are well recognised worldwide, including the World Health Organisation, it isn't hard to understand why there are almost 18 thousand Indian students currently pursuing their MBBS in Ukraine. Tapping into the opportunity there are education consultancy firms that present students with lucrative offers and build partnerships with universities in Ukraine to make it a viable option for the students. \u00a0",

        "content": "Russian troops pressed toward Ukraine\u2019s capital Saturday after a night of explosions and street fighting sent Kyiv residents seeking shelter underground. The country\u2019s leader refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting he would stay. \u201cThe fight is here,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. It was not immediately clear how far Russian troops had advanced. Ukrainian officials reported some success in fending off assaults, but fighting persisted near the capital. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Russia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but civilians have been killed and injured during Europe\u2019s largest ground war since World War II. A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in the city\u2019s southwestern outskirts near one of Kyiv\u2019s two passenger airports, Mayor Vitali Klitchsko said, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured. The mayor extended a 10 p.m.-7 a.m. curfew he imposed two days to run from 5 p.m. until 8 a.m. as of Saturday. \u201cAll civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy\u2019s sabotage and reconnaissance groups,\u201d Klitschko said. The conflict has already driven hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from their homes. U.N. officials said more than 120,000 Ukrainians have left the country for Poland, Moldova and other neighboring nations. Saturday\u2019s street clashes followed two days of massive air and missile strikes as Russian soldiers moved in from the north, east and south. The assault pummeled bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods, and resulted in hundreds of casualties. It was unclear in the fog of war how much of Ukraine was still under Ukrainian control and how much Russian forces have seized. Russia\u2019s defense ministry claimed the Russian military had taken full control of the southern city of Melitopol, about 22 miles (35 kilometer)s inland from the Azov Sea coast, and said Russia-backed separatists had made significant gains in the eastern region of Donbas. Ukrainian and Western officials, however, say Ukrainian forces have managed to slow the Russian advance. Ukraine\u2019s Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling water reservoir that serves Kyiv. Western officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government and replace it with a regime of his own. The invasion represented Putin\u2019s boldest effort yet to redraw the map of Europe and revive Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin. Zelenskyy offered renewed assurance Saturday that the country\u2019s military would stand up to the Russian invasion. In a defiant video recorded on a downtown Kyiv street, he said he remained in the city and that claims the Ukrainian military would put down arms were false. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. \u201cOur weapon is our truth, and our truth is that it\u2019s our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.\u201d Zelenskyy said in a second video later Saturday Moscow\u2019s plan to quickly seize the capital and install a puppet government had been unsuccessful. In an emotional speech, he accused the Russian forces of hitting civilian areas and infrastructure. The president\u2019s whereabouts were kept secret after he told European leaders in a call Thursday that he was Russia\u2019s No. 1 target \u2014 and that they might not see him again alive. The U.S. government urged Zelenskyy early Saturday to evacuate Kyiv but he turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying that \u201cthe fight is here\u201d and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but \u201cnot a ride.\u201d The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Ukraine\u2019s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, have been killed and more than 1,000 others have been wounded since the Russian offensive started before dawn Thursday. It was unclear whether the figure included both military and civilian casualties. Ukrainian officials say hundreds of Russians have been killed in the first days of fighting. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.",

And when she\u2019s not out solving complex diplomatic issues, she likes to kick back and watch pro-wrestling. It is the second and third volumes of this manga that have released for free because in them Hatta goes to Kyiv at the request of her former college roommate to help defuse a potential crisis with Russia. Although it\u2019s a fictional story, it is based on the real history between these countries as well as the rest of Eastern Europe. It also outlines many of the issues behind the current situation in detail and has bits of more casual trivia about Ukrainian culture, like their traditional food of Broscht, to keep people interested and help us gain a deeper appreciation for the region. \u25bc The free release was suddenly announced via Twitter by the manga\u2019s magazine. \u300e\u7d1b\u4e89\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3089\u516b\u7530\u307e\u3067\u300f\u306e\u5358\u884c\u672c\u7b2c\uff12\uff06\uff13\u5dfb\u306b\u53ce\u9332\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u7de8\u5168\uff16\u8a71\u3092\u6025\u907d\u7121\u6599\u516c\u958b\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002https://t.co/ogkUAICPAS\u2014 \u30e2\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u516c\u5f0f (@morningmanga) February 24, 2022 The full series was published in the weekly magazine Morning since 2019, but moved to their online platform D-Morning, where new episodes continue. However, for a limited but undetermined period the Ukraine arc in its entirety can be read freely on the website Comic Days immediately and without any registration. Unfortunately it is only available in Japanese, but every bit helps when it comes to educating and giving a background to what\u2019s going on. By getting as much information as possible we can prepare ourselves for whatever happens next in this rapidly unfolding situation.

Inaugurating France\u2019s Agricultural Fair in Paris on Saturday, Macron told farmers that sectors from wine to cereals to exports and energy prices will be affected by the conflict. \u201cWar has returned to Europe. This war was unilaterally chosen by Putin,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must prepare ourselves with lots of determination and also lots of solidarity.\u201d He said a \u201cplan of resilience\u201d was being put in place, but did not elaborate. The yearly Agriculture Fair, canceled last year due to the COVID crisis, is typically a must-visit event for French presidents, all the more so this year with presidential elections in April. But Macron, who has yet to declare his candidacy,\u00e1\u00e1cut short his planned day-long visit to a brief stay to warn farmers that they are among those who will be taking collateral damage from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union, along with the U.S. and numerous other countries, has announced sanctions against Russia, while trying to avoid blowback onto their own populations. RELATED: Trudeau announces 3rd round of sanctions against Russia, supports removing country from SWIFT A senior Russian official has warned that Moscow could react to Western sanctions over its attack on Ukraine by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact and freezing Western assets. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council chaired by President Vladimir Putin, shrugged off a set of crippling sanctions that the U.S., the European Union and other allies slapped on Russia as a reflection of Western \u201cpolitical impotence.\u201d In comments posted on his page on Russian social media VKontakte, Medvedev said the sanctions could offer Moscow a pretext for a complete review of its ties with the West, suggesting that Russia could opt out of the New START nuclear arms control treaty that limits the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. Medvedev also raised the prospect of cutting diplomatic ties with Western countries, saying \u201cthere is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations\u201d and adding that \u201cwe may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.\u201d He pointed at the possibility of freezing Western assets in the country if the West proceeds with threats to freeze Russian assets.",

        "content": "Madonna shared a video of her dancing to a 2006 hit along with clips of the attacks on Ukraine (Picture: Instagram @madonna ) Madonna has been followed by president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy after posting a bizarre video montage of the Ukraine crisis set to one of her songs. The singer, 63, voiced her support for Ukraine after Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-fledged invasion on the country on Thursday. She condemned Putin\u2019s actions and urged people to donate to humanitarian charities, while also sharing a remix of her 2006 song Sorry set to clips of the bloody conflict. The video shows bombs falling on Ukraine and citizens covered in blood, as well as clips of President Putin and Adolf Hitler, with Hitler\u2019s face at times superimposed on to Putin. Clips of Madonna dancing appear intermittently throughout the video. The montage also features text of the lyrics from Sorry, with \u2018Lies\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t take it\u2019 appearing over Putin\u2019s face and a map of the airstrikes on Ukraine as Madonna dances. https://www.instagram.com/p/Caa99CLJrBd/ Madonna\u2019s unique tribute has been welcomed by some for raising further awareness of the devastation in Ukraine, with President Zelenskyy following the musician on Instagram. However others criticised her for what they called a \u2018tone-deaf\u2019 or \u2018narcissistic\u2019 approach, some accusing her of using the crisis to promote herself and her music. One person, writing to her on Instagram, said: \u2018I take situation in the Ukraine seriously and Madonna posts a music video including images of her gyrating in a leotard\u2026 \u2018It\u2019s not the time or place for that. I feel she could have shown her support in a much more sensitive manner.\u2019 As well as the video, Madonna shared a written tribute to Ukraine and its people, writing: \u2018Russia\u2019s Pointless and Greed Driven Invasion Of the Ukraine MUST be stopped!! Madonna urged people to donate to humanitarian charities to assist with the crisis (Picture: Getty) \u2018Please Send in Humanitarian Aid to help millions of citizens of the Ukraine who\u2019s lives are being affected by this CRISIS at this very moment (sic).\u2019 She added: \u2018Putin has Violated Every Human Rights Accord in Existence.

Dogfight between Ukrainian MiG29 and Russian Su27 simulated in DCS World\u2019. The clip, which has over a million views, refers to an unconfirmed but quickly spreading story about the \u2018Ghost of Kyiv\u2019 Ukrainian ace, who allegedly managed to single-handedly down six enemy aircraft. However, that clip was first uploaded to YouTube with the title \u2018Ghost of Kiev kill\u2019. The uploader claimed the footage was made with a digital combat simulator in the description box. DCS stands for Digital Combat Simulator World, a digital battlefield game developed by Eagle Dynamics. Read more Game footage being shared as \u2018Ukraine videos\u2019 A spokesperson for the company Matthias Techmanski confirmed in an email to Reuters that the footage was from DCS, and that Eagle Dynamics was \u201cnot responsible for its distribution,\u201d and does not endorse \u201csuch content.\u201dThe Reuters fact check said the footage was \u2018miscaptioned\u2019 and comes from a video game. Twitter on Saturday flagged the Ukrainian Defense Ministry\u2019s post as misleading. It said that \"this media is presented out of context.\" Some users deleted the misleading video and apologized. There have been a number of other videos making their way around social media described as footage of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, thus highlighting the long-standing problem in which unverified videos with little to no context or research end up being spread throughout social media and are even picked up by government accounts.",

The Last Leg returned on Friday night with Josh Widdicombe, Adam Hills and Alex Brooker on hand to offer up all their honest takes of the week so far.\u00a0 TV favourite Lorraine returned as a guest on the much-loved Channel 4 programme in which the hosts fail to shy away from difficult topics. Of course, Russia/Ukraine conflict was at the top of the agenda, with the latter nation now under heavy attack with troops pouring in and bombs heard across several cities. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live Host Adam asked Lorraine: \u2018How is World War Three going for you?\u2019 Lorraine had plenty to say as she despaired over the news (Picture: Channel 4) She quickly replied: \u2018Oh my god. We\u2019re just getting out of the darkness of Covid into the light and then, wham. \u2018I wonder, what is going on with this odd, strange, nutty person that is Putin. What is going on?\u00a0 \u2018You have to ask yourself, what is the end game here?\u2019 Lorraine remarked. The star asked of Putin \u2018what is his end game here?\u2019 (Picture: Channel 4) Turning to Josh, she said: \u2018You were worried about [Putin] not being angry, you can\u2019t tell.\u00a0 \u2018You can\u2019t tell anything with him because he\u2019s had so much work done \u2013 allegedly \u2013 that his face, is just so weird. It looks like a candle has melted, and then hardened.\u00a0 The TV presenter went on to make a comparison to film House of Wax, noting of character Vincent Price: \u2018He had a face like that, the someone battered him and there was a horrible monster underneath. Putin has invaded Ukraine (Picture Alexei Nikolsky/TASS via Getty Images) \u2018It\u2019s very rare that someone says you\u2019re too young to remember something isn\u2019t it,\u2019 Alex weighed in. \u2018You\u2019re only a child, it\u2019s like something out of Game of Thrones. I don\u2019t understand why this would be happening, I feel like I\u2019m living through the worst dream,\u2019 she replied. \u2018I like how you said \u2018allegedly\u2019 because you\u2019re worried Vladimir Putin is going to take time out from the war to sue you,\u2019 Josh joked. \u2018Obviously, he has, nobody\u2019s got a face like that, weren\u2019t born with that wee face I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Lorraine concluded. It came just hours after the talk show host was criticised for her segue from an interview, where she said of the conflict: \u2018Life does go on.\u2019 She spoke to Good Morning Britain\u2019s chief correspondent Richard Gaisford, while he was reporting live from Kyiv, before moving straight on to Avril Lavigne.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on Thursday and the battle has now reached capital city Kyiv, with Ukrainian military fighting off several attacks on Saturday morning.

I actually signed up for the reserves last week, last Saturday, I just didn\u2019t have enough documents to sign the contract. \u2018Now they have cancelled that procedure and basically everybody who is motivated enough can join. \u2018I don\u2019t have military experience but I do have gun experience privately. I don\u2019t see the reason why the majority of our countrymen have to risk their lives to send their families away while I sit back.\u2019 At least 198 Ukrainians have been killed in the invasion so far (Picture: AFP) Stakhovsky also praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has stayed in Kyiv and remains defiant against Russia, while the 36-year-old former tennis star took aim at the lack of support Ukraine has received since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. He continued: \u2018Let\u2019s be realistic here, it\u2019s been eight years of the war against Russia \u2013 whether it is Russian proxies or Russia itself it doesn\u2019t matter. \u2018Where was all of this for eight years? None of us would believe that this could happen and yet it happened. A year before Putin annexed Crimea, Stakhovsky beat Federer (Picture: Getty) \u2018And none of the European leaders, or world leaders, are ready to help, ready to put the fight in Ukraine for maybe a better Europe in the future. \u2018We want to be a normal, civilised country, with a democracy where you can actually elect your president. \u2018And as far as I can go I can say that, today, the president we have is most likely the only president which we\u2019ve ever had in terms of standing up for his country and believing on what he does and risking his own life.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: India abstained from voting UN Security Council resolution condemning Russia's \"aggression\" against Ukraine and calling for Russian troops to leave the neighbouring country. New Delhi stated the only way to resolve conflicts and disputes is through conversation, and expressed \"regret\" that \"path of diplomacy was given up\". On Friday, UNSC voted on a draught resolution proposed by US and Albania and backed by Italy, Germany, Estonia and many more. The resolution failed to pass when Russia, a permanent member, exercised its veto. The resolution garnered 11 votes in favour and three abstentions from the UN Security Council's 15 members, including India, China, and UAE. TS Tirumurti, India's Permanent Representative UN, stated that no solution can be reached at the expense of human lives. Tirumurti has concern for the Indian community's safety and security in Ukraine. The urgent focus is particularly on stranded students and their evacuation from Ukraine. According to Tirumurti, by abstaining, India kept the option of reaching out to relevant parties in an attempt to bridge the difference and find a middle ground in order to develop conversation and diplomacy. A previous draught of the resolution advocated shifting it to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which establishes the framework for the Security Council to conduct enforcement action. Reports state this was removed from the final form before it was submitted to a vote.Also Read:\u00a0Russia-Ukraine Crisis: Marine Battalion Blows Himself Up On A Bridge To Halt The EnemyAlso Watch:",

Further concrete support is on its way.\u201d However, the EU Council head did not respond to the call for EU membership. Discussions on EU membership for Ukraine have been ongoing for a number of years without any concrete outcome. On February 23, Poland and Lithuania signed a declaration saying that Ukraine should be granted the status of candidate for EU membership. Zelensky has also repeatedly called for clarity regarding Ukraine\u2019s prospects for membership in NATO. The possibility that Ukraine might join NATO in the future is one of the reasons behind Russia\u2019s decision to launch a military action. The offensive started on February 24 with the stated goals of \u201cdemilitarizing\u201d Ukraine, protecting the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, and ensuring that Russia is not placed under threat by NATO from Ukrainian territory. Western nations, however, have remained unconvinced by these arguments. The widespread condemnation of the \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack has caused a massive wave of sanctions against Russia and the cancelation of various sporting and cultural events.",

Ukraine said the attack was entirely unprovoked and appealed to the international community for help. The Russian military said on Friday that its troops seized an airfield near Kiev and began encircling the city. Ukraine did not confirm the loss of the airfield, but pulled more armored units into the capital, preparing to defend the city. Ukrainian officials reported sporadic firefights in the suburbs.

She wrote: \u2018I am heartbroken and dumbstruck trying to process the events of this week in my birthplace of Ukraine. https://www.instagram.com/p/Caa-ZaJpOVj/ \u2018My country and people being bombed.

        "content": "Taiwan:\u00a0China could invade Taiwan after seeing the West's response to Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, a leading historian has warned, Daily Mail reported.Professor of European studies at the Oxford University, Timothy Garton Ash, said that Xi Jinping taking over the island militarily would be a 'worst case scenario', the report said. The political writer claimed that the Communist leader will be thinking: \"If comrade Vladimir (Putin) can get away with it in Ukraine, maybe I'll have a go.\" He also warned Putin's 'minimal aim' is to bring a new iron curtain down over eastern Europe because he wants to create a new empire, Daily Mail reported. Ash's warnings came a day after Taiwan's air force scrambled its fighter planes to warn away nine Chinese aircraft in its air defence zone. At the same time, Putin's forces continued to sweep across Ukraine and reached the outskirts of Kiev by Friday morning. Ash said the devastating conflict - which has already seen hundreds slaughtered - is just the beginning of Russia's plans. He told BBC Question Time: \"He (Putin) has effectively already invaded Belarus, which is just next to Ukraine. Because he put all his forces in there and they're there for as long as he wants them to be there. \"So I think the minimal aim of Vladimir Putin is to create a new iron curtain down the Eastern frontier of NATO so that countries like Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia will be stuck in the Russian empire whether they like it or not,\" as per the report.

        "description": "Many students from Maharashtra have gone to Ukraine for medical studies. Parents of 366 such students have contacted us for their evacuation, Pawar said",
        "content": "Several students from Maharashtra will land in Delhi and Mumbai on Saturday after their evacuation from war-ravaged Ukraine, and the state government will help them to reach their respective native places on their arrival, state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme here, Pawar also said there is no threat to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress as long as the magic figure of 145 in the 288-member House is on its side. \"Many students from Maharashtra have gone to Ukraine for medical studies. Parents of 366 such students have contacted us for their evacuation. Thirty-two students from the state will land in Delhi today. We have opened a counter of Maharashtra at the Delhi airport. The state government will bear the expenses of bringing these students back to Maharashtra,\" he said. \"Apart from them, around 240 students from different states will land in Mumbai this afternoon. We have also opened a counter at the Mumbai airport. The state government will provide help to these students to reach their respective places,\" Pawar added. Russia launched a military operation against Ukraine on Thursday following weeks of tension between the two neighbouring countries. When asked about the BJP's criticism that the MVA government won't survive long in the wake of Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's arrest, he said, \"I don't want to comment on the opponents' statement about the MVA's survival. But despite their claims, till the magic figure of 145 is there in the state assembly and till the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena are together, the government will remain strong.\" Malik was arrested on Wednesday by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering case. Pawar said, raids are taking place on members of every party except one. Now people will understand why this is happening. On Friday, local leaders in Pune said the workers of the three MVA parties would stage a protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the city on March 6. The protest will be against the PM's statement in Parliament blaming the Maharashtra government for the spread of coronavirus, they said. Modi is expected to visit Pune on March 6 for the inauguration of metro rail service, but there has been no official intimation about his programme yet. Asked about his party NCP's opposition to the PM's visit, Pawar said, \"PM Modi is coming to Pune. As a deputy CM, I will be welcoming him. We are requesting Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to come along if his health allows. Modi has the right to conduct a programme in Pune. The state and the Centre both have given funds for the metro rail, so there will be joint programme.\" On the growing demand for the classical language status to Marathi, the senior NCP leader said, \"We have been following up with the Union government for the classical language status to Marathi language. There are only five to six languages that have got this status, but Marathi hasn't got it.\" The number of Marathi-speaking people is huge not only in Maharashtra, Goa and other states, but also in other countries. It is up to the central government to take a decision on it (status). In the last state legislature session, there was some positive discussion about it. Minister Subhash Desai, who holds the portfolio of Marathi language, had recently visited Delhi on this issue and he was positive about it, he said. On Gudhi Padwa (Marathi New Year), foundation stone-laying ceremony of the proposed Marathi Bhasha Bhavan will take place in Mumbai, he added.",

Jaishankar and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Friday discussed the prevailing situation in the east European country which is under attack from Russia, along with the measures to evacuate stranded Indian nationals from there.\"Received call from Ukrainian FM @DmytroKuleba. He shared his assessment of the current situation. I emphasised that India supports diplomacy and dialogue as the way out,\" Jaishankar tweeted. The minister also stated that they discussed the predicament of Indian nationals, including students. \"Appreciate his support for their safe return,\" Jaishankar said. Earlier in the day, US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, spoke to Jaishankar and called for collective response over the ongoing crisis. Blinken tweeted, \"Spoke with @DrSJaishankar today about the crisis in Ukraine and the importance of a strong collective response to Russian aggression. Russia's attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is a clear violation of the rules-based international order.\" The spokesperson for the US Secretary of State, Ned Price, said, \"Antony Blinken spoke with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar today to discuss Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine.\" Price also stated that Blinken stressed the importance of a strong, collective response to condemn Russia's invasion and call for immediate force withdrawal and ceasefire. On Thursday, India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had stated that Jaishankar has spoken to concerned officials in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia for setting up camps on the border areas for evacuation of stranded Indian nationals. India is working out evacuation plans through Romania, Hungary and Poland, after Ukraine shut its airspace soon after the Russian military operation began on Thursday.

        "description": "Russia claims it has blocked Kyiv from the west, people with Covid no longer have to isolate and Brits worry for the Queen.",
        "content": "Terrifying scenes have come from Ukraine while the UK has become one of the first countries to lift Covid isolation rules (Picture: Metro.co.uk) It\u2019s been a monumentally grim week for news \u2013 even by pandemic standards. We wouldn\u2019t blame you for hating the idea of rehashing it all on the day your weekend has finally started. But before you head out to drown your state-of-the-world sorrows in a pint, Metro.co.uk has summarised everything you need to know to justify \u2018just one more\u2019. Plus, it\u2019s pretty important. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live The Russia-Ukraine war After weeks of tense speculation about whether Russia would invade Ukraine, president Vladimir Putin gave the green light and chaos completely descended on the eastern European country on Thursday. Air raid sirens have sounded across Ukraine as multiple targets were hit with missile strikes. Dramatic photos show apartment buildings utterly destroyed in Kyiv and other big cities. Many families tried to flee Kyiv but traffic jams around the capital have made this very difficult. Thousands spent Thursday night in makeshift bomb bunkers, which included Kyiv\u2019s underground subway network. The Russian military insists there \u2018no threat to civilian population\u2019 but several towns and cities have been targeted, leading to the death of one young boy who died in an explosion in Chuhiv. Multiple Ukrainians have been left badly wounded after a night of airstrikes (Picture: Getty) Many Ukrainians slept in different city underground subway networks (Picture: Twitter/@danriversitv) By the end of Thursday, Russian forces had captured Chernobyl \u2013 a still-active nuclear site which lies around 60 miles from Kyiv. Radiation levels have risen since the capture but not to any critical stage yet. Experts estimate the change has been brought on by heavy military equipment disturbing soil and lifting radioactive dust into the air. Russia claimed it seized Kyiv and cut the capital off from the West yesterday afternoon. The Ukrainian government urged its citizens to help soldiers and make Molotov cocktails to \u2018neutralise the enemy\u2019. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T1M25S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/25\\/07\\/54636905-0-image-a-31_1645772934018.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-25T07:06:58+0000\",\"description\":\"Ukraine's president addressed the nation unshaven and in a t-shirt, as he feared for his family's safety.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/25\\/5079499558554745846\\/480x270_MP4_5079499558554745846.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Putin has put a target on him and his family\u2019s heads but he has insisted he will not leave Kyiv. In a speech from his bunker, president Zelensky appealed to Ukraine\u2019s western neighbours to toughen their reactions. He said: \u2018If you don\u2019t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.\u2019 TL;DR: Russia has taken the capital and Ukraine\u2019s president is asking for help. Britain\u2019s response to Russian invasion Earlier this week, before Russia\u2019s invasion turned into the full-scale attack we are seeing now, Boris Johnson set out several milder sanctions against the superpower. He froze the assets of five Russian banks and imposed travel bans on three Russian oligarchs. Critics called for harsher action and the prime minister on Thursday announced the \u2018largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen\u2019. Mr Johnson said he would \u2018exclude Russian banks from the British financial system\u2019 by stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T4M36S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/24\\/17\\/54610919-0-image-a-24_1645722924663.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-24T17:15:26+0000\",\"description\":\"Boris Johnson announces the repercussions that Putin's Russia will face for invading Ukraine.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/24\\/6042089158468583785\\/480x270_MP4_6042089158468583785.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video As well as making the UK\u2019s banking sanctions more severe, Mr Johnson has come down harder on Russian billionaires \u2013 including Putin\u2019s former son-in-law. More than 100 businesses and individuals with dealings in the UK have also been targeted. Although the UK and other NATO countries have sent weapons to Ukraine as individual countries, the alliance itself has not become involved as Ukraine is not a member. Mr Johnson delivered a powerful speech on Thursday, telling the Commons: \u2018Putin will stand condemned in the eyes of the world and of history. He will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands.\u2019 TL;DR: The UK has harshened sanctions against Russia. Covid rules scrapped in England In news you never thought could ever be overshadowed, people who get coronavirus no longer have to isolate. As part of the Government\u2019s \u2018living with Covid\u2019 plan, those who get infected are under no legal obligation to quarantine. However, the public health advice is still to stay at home for five days and limit your contact with other people. Face masks are no longer compulsory on public transport (Picture: Getty) It comes with an end to free Covid testing, compulsory face masks, routine contact tracing, \u00a3500 self-isolation payments and more. Yes, the pandemic and all the ways it has irreversibly changed our lives has come to some sort of an anti-climactic end on a random Thursday. TL;DR: Stay at home if you have Covid but no one will fine you if you don\u2019t. The Queen battles Covid Her Majesty tested positive for the virus on Sunday, after she started to feel ill the week before. This will be the second week the Queen has felt too unwell to carry out virtual engagements but Buckingham Palace insists she is continuing with \u2018light duties\u2019. Many Brits are worried about the 95-year-old monarch, who has spent more than three months resting on doctors\u2019 orders anyway. She is understood to be triple-jabbed and getting very good medical treatment. People have been worried about the Queen since her previous health scare (Picture: PA) TL;DR: As always, Her Majesty is keeping calm and carrying on. Dad gets creative with hoover Loads of people have had the time to take up new hobbies in the last two hellish years, and Tom Quirk, 36,\u00a0used these spare hours to polish up on his secret talent \u2013 creating art with his vacuum cleaner. But this Avante Garde artwork is no lockdown fad pining after the love and care you can no longer be bothered to give it. No. This love affair started before any restrictions came along, and it\u2019s clear the relationship will survive the faster pace of regular life. Tom started just by messing around, but now he is able to make stunning portraits of famous people, including Slash, the Mona Lisa and Donald Trump. Tom\u2019s portrait of Donald Trump (Picture: Caters News) Tom\u2019s 15-minute version of the Mona Lisa (Picture: Caters News) He said: \u2018You have to hoover the rug all over in just one direction first so it gives you an all over light image. \u2018Then I remove the hose and add the thin attachment to the end and drag the long fibres the opposite direction to get the shadows of faces. \u2018It normally takes me about 15 to 20 minutes which isn\u2019t bad considering it took Leonardo Da Vinci four years to do the Mona Lisa.\u2019 TL;DR: Pick up your pandemic hobby again.

The diplomat noted, however, that Russia expects some areas to be added to the two newly-recognized Donbass republics so their territories match the borders within which they were recognized by Russia. Territorial gains have \u201cnever been our intention,\u201d Chizhov told Euractiv news outlet in an interview on Friday, when asked if Russian forces would leave Ukraine without making ground gains. \u201cWe have enough territory. What you may be indirectly implying is that the territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk people\u2019s republics will be actually extended to cover the whole of those two \u2018oblast,\u2019\u201d Chizhov said. The diplomat clarified that Moscow expects the territory that is de-facto under the control of Lugansk and Donetsk to match that \u201creflected in their constitutions.\u201d Read more Zelensky agreed to talks with Kremlin, venue being discussed \u2013 Kiev \u201cActually, what the Russian armed forces are doing is in support of the counterattack by the militias of the two now recognized Donbass republics,\u201d he said, referring to the ongoing military operation in Ukraine launched by Russia early on Thursday. Chizhov expressed hope that a \u201cpossible new government in Kyiv and authorities in Donetsk and Lugansk would be able to find common ground to negotiate friendly relations\u201d at some point. \u201cActually, the Russian army is there not to start the war, it is there to end the war,\u201d the Russian envoy to the EU said, echoing the assessment made by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova in a recent interview with RT. Russia launched a large-scale military operation in Ukraine on Thursday morning, seeking to \u201cdemilitarize and de-nazify\u201d Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. The development prompted the US, EU, UK, and Canada to impose a raft of sweeping sanctions on Russia, which have also personally targeted Putin, government ministers, high-ranking security and military officials and their families, as well as State Duma deputies. The West denounced the offensive as an \u201cunprovoked\u201d attack that violates Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. The Kremlin insisted that the military action was warranted, saying Kiev would have attempted to take the breakaway republics by force in the near future. Kiev had denied this.",

(KRON) - As hundreds of thousands of people continue to leave Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, others can't because Ukraine's martial law bans men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country.\u00a0 Among them is the father of a San Mateo man. \u201cIt's really disturbing times for all Ukrainians in the world,\u201d Mick Safron said.\u00a0 Mick Safron's parents were among the hundreds of thousands of people running away from the Russian invasion. \u201cNobody believed it would happen so people waited until the last moment at 5 a.m. or 4 a.m. when the first explosions started to happen all over Ukraine.

And financial markets are in a precarious spot as central banks prepare to reverse years of easy-money policies and raise interest rates to fight a resurgence of inflation. Those higher rates will likely slow spending and raise the risk of another downturn. \u00a0 \u2013 With files from The Associated Press",

I don't know what to do, but I am on the phone calling anybody I can to take a look at this thing. \"I feel very helpless. I feel very scared.\" He is in a group chat with his friends through a messenger app -- that's how they keep everyone informed of how they are doing. Doyle read off messages from his friends. \"His goal is to eliminate our country, people, and culture,\" Doyle said. \"We can confidently say that Ukraine will never give up. We're on our home ground and fight to win, but we also need support of the world community.\" He's encouraging people to reach out to organizations that are helping in Ukraine, like the Ukrainian American Coordinating Council. \"This has nothing to do with politics. This is about loss of life. This is about people being caught in the crossfire. Civilian buildings being bombed out,\" Doyle said. He says he will continue to check in on his friends and share their stories. \"We have \"X\" amount of people and luckily those numbers aren't falling,\" Doyle said.",

        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russian troops stormed toward Ukraine\u2019s capital early Saturday as explosions reverberated through the city and the president urged the country to \u201cstand firm\u201d against the siege that could determine its future. He refused American help to evacuate, saying: \u201cThe fight is here.\u201d Hundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government, which U.S. officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ultimate objective. The assault represented Putin\u2019s boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin. As his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack. \u201cThis night we have to stand firm,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\u201d Zelenskyy was urged to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying that \u201cthe fight is here\u201d and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but \u201cnot a ride.\u201d For their part, U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned, though that could change quickly. The Kremlin accepted Kyiv\u2019s offer to hold talks, but it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of the embattled Zelenskyy instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution. The Russian military continued its advance, laying claim Friday to the southern Ukraine city of Melitopol. Still, it was unclear in the fog of war how much of Ukraine is still under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces have seized. As fighting persisted, Ukraine\u2019s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers. The U.S. and other global powers slapped ever-tougher sanctions on Russia as the invasion reverberated through the world\u2019s economy and energy supplies, threatening to further hit ordinary households. U.N. officials said millions could flee Ukraine. Sports leagues moved to punish Russia and even the popular Eurovision song contest banned it from the May finals in Italy. Through it all, Russia remained unbowed, vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding that it stop attacking Ukraine and withdraw troops immediately. The veto was expected, but the U.S. and its supporters argued that the effort would highlight Moscow\u2019s international isolation. The 11-1 vote, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining, showed significant but not total opposition to Russia\u2019s invasion of its smaller, militarily weaker neighbor. The meeting exposed Russia-Ukraine frictions, including when Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya requested a moment of silence to pray for those killed and asked Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia to pray \u201cfor salvation.\u201d Nebenzia retorted that the remembrance should include people who have died in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region. Pro-Russian separatists there have been fighting the Ukrainian government, which Russia accuses of abuses. A moment of tense silence did ensue. NATO, meanwhile, decided to send parts of the alliance\u2019s response force to help protect its member nations in the east for the first time. NATO did not say how many troops would be deployed but added that it would involve land, sea and air power. Day Two of Russia\u2019s invasion, the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, focused on the Ukrainian capital, where Associated Press reporters heard explosions starting before dawn. Gunfire was reported in several areas. A large boom was heard in the evening near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. The cause was not immediately known. Five explosions struck near a major power plant on Kyiv\u2019s eastern outskirts, said Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. There was no information on what caused them, and no electrical outages were immediately reported. It was unclear how many people overall had died. Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side from the first full day of fighting and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures. U.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes. They estimate that up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates. Zelenskyy tweeted that he and U.S. President Joe Biden spoke by phone and discussed \u201cstrengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an antiwar coalition.\u201d His whereabouts were kept secret after Zelenskyy told European leaders in a call Thursday that he was Russia\u2019s No. 1 target \u2014 and that they might not see him again alive. His office later released a video of him standing with senior aides outside the presidential office and saying that he and other government officials would stay in the capital. Zelenskyy earlier offered to negotiate on a key Putin demand: that Ukraine declare itself neutral and abandon its ambition of joining NATO. The Kremlin said Kyiv initially agreed to have talks in Minsk, then said it would prefer Warsaw and later halted communications. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said later that Kyiv would discuss prospects for talks on Saturday. The assault was anticipated for weeks by the U.S. and Western allies and denied to be in the works just as long by Putin. He argued the West left him with no other choice by refusing to negotiate Russia\u2019s security demands. In a window into how the increasingly isolated Putin views Ukraine and its leadership, he urged Ukraine\u2019s military to surrender, saying: \u201cWe would find it easier to agree with you than with that gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have holed up in Kyiv and have taken the entire Ukrainian people hostage.\u201d Playing on Russian nostalgia for World War II heroism, the Kremlin equates members of Ukrainian right-wing groups with neo-Nazis. Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, angrily dismisses those claims. Putin has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov gave a hint, saying, \u201cWe want to allow the Ukrainian people to determine its own fate.\u201d Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia recognizes Zelenskyy as the president, but would not say how long the Russian military operation could last. Ukrainians abruptly adjusted to life under fire, after Russian forces invaded the country from three sides as they massed an estimated 150,000 troops nearby. Residents of a Kyiv apartment building woke to screaming, smoke and flying dust. What the mayor identified as Russian shelling tore off part of the building and ignited a fire. \u201cWhat are you doing? What is this?\u201d resident Yurii Zhyhanov asked Russian forces. Like countless other Ukrainians, he grabbed what belongings he could, took his mother, and fled, car alarms wailing behind him. Elsewhere in Kyiv, the body of a dead soldier lay near an underpass. Fragments of a downed aircraft smoked amid the brick homes of a residential area. Black plastic was draped over body parts found beside them. People climbed out of bomb shelters, basements and subways to face another day of upheaval. \u201cWe\u2019re all scared and worried. We don\u2019t know what to do then, what\u2019s going to happen in a few days,\u201d said Lucy Vashaka, 20, a worker at a small Kyiv hotel. At the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the U.S. believes the offensive, including its advance on Kiev, has gone more slowly than Moscow had planned, noting that Ukraine forces have been fighting back. But he also said the military campaign is in an early stage and circumstances can change rapidly. The Biden administration said Friday that it would move to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, following the European Union and Britain in directly sanctioning top Russian leadership. Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, called the sanctions against Putin and Lavrov \u201can example and a demonstration of a total helplessness\u201d of the West.",

Reema Singh, a medical student and daughter of ruling Janata Dal-United MLA Rajiv Kumar Singh, contacted her father on Friday and informed that she is safe. \"My daughter went to Ukraine for medical study in the first week of January this year. In a telephonic conversation, she said that she and other students are safe. The Ukrainian authorities has contacted students and informed them to pack only one hand bag. They will be dropped at the Romanian border which is just 30 km away from the place currently they are staying,\" Rajiv Singh, the MLA from Tarapur constituency, in Munger said. \"My daughter and other students are safe and need not to panic. The Russian troops are targeting military establishments and not the civilian areas. The Indian government has made a provision to rescue students through the Romania and Poland border situated on the west side of Ukraine,\" he added. Besides Reema Singh, three more students of Munger district are trapped in Ukraine. Several students of Bihar shared pictures of Ukraine. Many of them were walking on the roads heading towards Polish and Romanian borders. A student of Denlo Heliski medical college in Lviv city said that a group of 40 Indian students were heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border, but their college bus dropped them before the border. Sanjana Rathore, a third year medical student and resident of Vaishali, is another student trapped there. In a video message, she said: \"We have witnessed air strike on the airport yesterday and frequent shelling. The authorities could cut the internet line anytime. How would we contact our parents back home in Bihar. We are urging (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and (Chief Minister) Nitish Kumar for a quick rescue operation to save our lives.\" Pravin Kumar Bharti, another medical student and native of Saharsa, is also trapped. Meanwhile, Industry Minister S. Shahnawaz Hussain said that the government is committed to evacuate Indian students from Ukraine, and will bear the expenses of their air tickets. Nitish Kumar also said that the officials are in touch with the External Affairs Ministry and making efforts to carry out rescue operations.",

The Indian embassy in Ukraine issued a fresh advisory in view of increasing Russian attacks on several Ukrainian cities and reports of heavy fighting around the capital Kyiv. The embassy particularly advised those staying in the eastern part of Ukraine to continue to remain in their current places of residence and stay indoors or in shelters as much as possible. \"All Indian Citizens in Ukraine are advised to not move to any of the border posts without prior coordination with the government of India officials at the border posts (helpline numbers established) and the emergency numbers of the embassy of India in Kyiv,\" the embassy said. It said the situation at various border checkpoints is sensitive and the embassy is working continuously with the Indian missions in the neighbouring countries for coordinated evacuation of the citizens. \"Embassy is finding it increasingly difficult to help the crossing of those Indian nationals who reach border checkpoint without prior intimation,\" it said in the advisory. Notwithstanding the difficult ground situation, India on Friday managed to set up camp offices in Lviv and Chernivtsi towns in western Ukraine to facilitate the transit of Indians to Hungary, Romania and Poland. India also positioned teams of officials at Zahony border post in Hungary, Krakowiec as well as Shehyni-Medyka land border points in Poland, Vysne Nemecke in the Slovak Republic and Suceava transit point in Romania to coordinate the exit of Indian nationals from Ukraine.",

        "content": "NEW YORK: President Joe Biden has expressed hope that India would be in \"sync\" with the US on Ukraine.Asked at a news conference on Thursday, if India, a major defence partner, was in \"sync\" with the US on Russia and Ukraine, Biden said, \"We're going to be\". He added, \"We're in consultation with India today; we haven't resolved that completely\". Secretary of State Antony Blinken called External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday to speak about strong collective action against Russia, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said. Price said that \"Blinken stressed the importance of a strong collective response to condemn Russia's invasion and call for an immediate withdrawal and ceasefire\" when discussing \"Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine\". Jaishankar tweeted afterwards, \"Appreciate the call from @SecBlinken Discussed the ongoing developments in Ukraine and its implications\". Biden unveiled a series of economic and strategic sanctions on Russia at his news conference declaring, \"This is going to impose a severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time\". In retaliation for the Russian invasion of Ukraine ordered by Russia's President Vladimir Putin early Thursday morning, Biden said that the US and its allies would blunt Moscow's ability to participate in global trade by cutting off its ability to use dollars, euros, pounds and yen. As Russian forces attacked key sites in Ukraine and its troops entered that country and engaged with Ukrainian forces, Biden said: \"Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences\". Biden's sanctions taken in coordination with its allies, target Russia's banking sector, its hi-tech industries and its defence. But Biden ruled out sending troops to help the Ukrainians but said US forces would be going to NATO allies in the East. Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Daleep Singh, who briefed reporters on the sanctions, gave an assurance that the US actions would not disrupt the global energy sector. While primarily targeting the financial sector, the energy sector was exempted from sanctions, he said. He said, \"None of our measures is designed to disrupt the flow of energy to global markets. And we are now executing a plan in coordination with major oil producers and major oil consumers to secure the stability of global energy supplies\". The Brent crude oil was trading above $101 barrel on Thursday night. Singh said that \"no Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds\". \"We are ready to press a button to take action on the two largest Russian financial institutions, which collectively hold almost $750 billion in assets \u2013 or more than half of the total in the Russian banking system,\" he warned. In the first sanctions imposed by the US and its allies, the fifth-largest Russian financial institution, VEB has more than $50 billion in assets, and the military-linked Promsvyazbank that holds $35 billion in assets have been blocked from any transactions with the US and Europe, he said. India is facing a dilemma on how to deal with Russia, its longstanding friend and defence supplier, while its ties with the West are growing and it is getting more tied into the global economic situation. New Delhi will be tested when a resolution against Russia is introduced in the Security Council by the US and its allies, and it will have to take aside. India abstained on a procedural vote on the agenda proposed by the West at a Council meeting in January on Ukraine. India's Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti warned Wednesday night at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, \"The situation is in danger of spiralling into a major crisis. We express our deep concern over the developments, which if not handled carefully, may well undermine the peace and security of the region\". Without naming Russia, he expressed \"regret that the calls of the international community to give time to the recent initiatives undertaken by parties to diffuse tensions were not heeded to\".

        "description": "Russia has declared war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and is executing a plan meticulously prepared and war games.",
        "content": "Major Generals B Asthana(Major General S.B. Asthana is a strategic and security analyst, a veteran Infantry General. He is the Chief Instructor, United Service Institution of India. The views expressed are personal) Russia has declared war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and is executing a plan meticulously prepared and war games. NATO appears to have over-relied on the potency of its sanctions to deter Putin, which appears to be a major strategic error because it has not worked in the past and does not appear to be working now. Instead, it has emboldened Russian leadership's resolve that NATO will be unable to respond to a quick offensive beyond condemnation, Ukraine's capacity building, and sanctions on Russia.It has pushed Ukraine to disaster, as its President's loud demand to join NATO was neither acted upon by the West nor provided him with any assurance that anyone else would do the heavy lifting or put boots on the ground in Ukraine to fight Russians, despite a massive military force imbalance in Russia's favour. Decoding Strategic and Military Action of Russia so far The contours and logic of Russian plans were evident from its posturing over months, President Putin's speeches to the nation and his demands made to Ukraine. The political aim of Russia seems to be to target Ukraine's leadership to give up demand of NATO membership, or else force a regime change, replacing it with a pro-Russian government not propagating NATO membership/agenda. Strategically, the centre of gravity for the Russian offensive is the minds of Ukraine's leadership and military to surrender to Russia with minimum military actions. This strategic goal cannot be realized without surrounding Kyiv, which is the key strategic objective; as a result, operations to encircle Kyiv and capture adjacent airbases have been launched. After Russia recognized the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, the liberation of the Donbas region was a foregone conclusion. The military aim is to demilitarize the Ukrainian military to ensure that Ukraine cannot be used as a springboard by NATO to threaten the security of Russia and isolate Kyiv to facilitate regime change without military interference. To shape the battlefield, the Russian military postured three sides of Ukraine with massive combat superiority, used forces in Belarus to invade from the North to reach Kyiv via shortest route, used its Black Sea fleet and Crimea to blockade Ukraine from the South, and forces in Donbas region to invade from the east and some forces from northeast to expedite consolidation. The military operations were preceded by cyber-attacks and information warfare. Military operations were launched in a well-planned and professional manner under the banner of 'Special Operations,' beginning with air and missile strikes to neutralize air defence capability, air assets to achieve air superiority, and pulverize military targets, claiming to have destroyed over 70 military targets and installations, including 11 airfields in Ukraine, before ground elements marched in, adding conventional superiority to upgrade its hybrid war. NATO's response and future options President Biden's address on February 22, and statements of other western leaders, clearly indicated that NATO is not going to have boots on the ground in Ukraine and will depend on financial sanctions and material support to Ukraine as a response to Russian aggression. This weakness emboldened Russia to seize the opportunity for an offensive into Ukraine with minimum military cost, so far. NATO is still unclear about further responses, as the Russian offensive is already underway; hence time for any possible military action by NATO is already over. NATO, therefore, is only salvaging its security by strengthening NATO countries bordering Ukraine/Russia to prevent any possibility of Russian adventurism into any of the NATO countries, leaving Ukraine to its fate, as it's not a member of NATO as yet. Likely Russian action ahead Russia will try to achieve its strategic objectives as fast as possible and move out of Ukraine to minimize its cost. It will avoid fighting in built-up areas, as it will prolong the invasion and may not remain as an occupational force to avoid backlash from a segment of the hostile population turning into an insurgency against it. It will therefore try to maximize pressure on Ukraine by all instruments of power to submit to regime change or force it at the earliest and de-escalate. Notwithstanding what Russia wants, the resolve of the Ukrainian military and leadership will determine the timeframe and escalation dynamics and the support of NATO to refuel resistance will determine the staying power. Russia is unlikely to make the mistake of annexing Ukraine, as it does not make sense in a strategic cost-benefit analysis. To build pressure for Ukraine to surrender, Russia may also take over some key strategic installations, till its strategic aims are achieved. It's a harsh punishment for Ukraine's uncomfortable geopolitical location and leadership's desire to join NATO, which has thrust it into the centre of a \"Big Power Contestation\" that is going to be a tragedy for its people, in all contingencies. Indian response The priority for India should be to evacuate its students and diaspora. It can push for diplomatic solutions and peaceful resolutions, as well as measures to reduce temperatures, but it should avoid taking sides because it has good connections with all of the opposing powers. While each country's sovereignty must be maintained, both sides have rejected it when it has served their interests, as in the Iraq war, Crimea and Afghanistan. India needs to factor the weak Western response to the Ukraine crisis in its strategic calculations, as it can embolden other authoritative powers like China to take similar actions in the Indo-Pacific region.

The move comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnston and French President Emmanuel Macron called on UEFA to move the prestigious tournament. \u201cI think it inconceivable that major international football tournaments can take place in Russia after\u2026 the invasion of a sovereign country,\u201d stated Johnston on Tuesday. Adding to the Champions League, the defending title holders Chelsea FC are concerned for their future, as the British government looks to seize the assets of the club\u2019s owner Roman Abramovich. Abramovich is one of Russia\u2019s richest people and it is believed he might have close ties to Russian President Vladamir Putin. The British government is looking at ways to remove Abramovich from his position with the London-based club, and rumours have begun circulating that the club could be sold. Abramovich bought the club in 2003, has increased the club\u2019s value to roughly 1.9 billion euros and the team has won 21 trophies in that time. Formula 1 On Thursday, Formula 1 announced the removal of the Sochi Grand Prix from the 2022 season calendar. The move followed talks with stakeholders and teams after some of the drivers stated earlier in the day they would not race in Russia. Hass F1 team also cut all ties with Russian sponsors. The team removed all Uralkali sponsor logos and completed day three of pre-season testing in Barcelona using a plain white livery. Uralkali became the main sponsor of Hass F1 team after the team announced Nikita Mazepin as one of their two drivers for the 2021 season. Nikita\u2019s father Dmitry Mazepin is the founder of the company Uralkali. Dmitry Mazepin was one of Russia\u2019s business leaders that was seen meeting with Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Hass team principal spoke with media on Friday and said the team would be looking into the status of Nikita Mazepin in F1. A decision is expected to be made next week.

The pair will meet in the APT Dubai Final. Skiing The International Ski Federation (FIS) also announced Friday that Russia will not host any more World Cup ski events. The announcement came after the FIS failed to host a ski cross event on Friday. The FIS said a handful of Russian skiers started the races, however many athletes from other countries including Canada did not take part in the event. -With files from Sportsnet staff and the Canadian Press",

Labour MP Chris Bryant has urged the UK government to seize Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich\u2019s assets. Earlier in the week, the government announced it would impose sanctions on three billionaires with close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the UK\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion. Mr Abramovich is one of Russia\u2019s richest people and is believed to be close to President Putin. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live The Russian military began their invasion in eastern Europe on Thursday and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday evening that the Russians will storm the capital Kyiv in the coming hours. Chelsea boss Tuchel, who is preparing for Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley, said: \u2018We shouldn\u2019t pretend this is not an issue. The situation for everyone here is horrible. \u2018Nobody expected this, it\u2019s pretty unreal. It\u2019s clouding our minds, and our excitement towards the final. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is believed to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin (Picture: Getty) \u2018It brings huge uncertainty, much more to all people in the moment more involved than us. We send our best wishes and regards to them, obviously. \u2018Still there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club, in the UK with scenarios like this, that it makes no sense if I comment on it. \u2018We\u2019re aware of it, we haven\u2019t got so much insight or inside information than you might think, and in the very end, I think it\u2019s also the right from the team and staff to be not political, to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding, but the situation is clear, it\u2019s horrible, no doubt about it. \u2018I\u2019d love to take my right not to comment on it until there is a decision made. It\u2019s distracting us, it\u2019s worrying us, to a certain degree I can understand it, I can understand the critical opinions towards the club and us who represent it. We cannot fully free ourselves from it. \u2018But maybe people can understand me as the coach, and players as players, we don\u2019t have the insight what is going on and how much the owner is involved in all this \u2013 we don\u2019t feel responsible for what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s horrible and there can\u2019t be a doubt about it, war in Europe is unthinkable for me for a long period of time. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T13M22S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/25\\/14\\/54651879-0-image-a-9_1645800648851.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-25T15:08:50+0000\",\"description\":\"Press conference with Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel ahead of his side's Carabao Cup final clash with Liverpool.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/25\\/2531803524864559001\\/480x270_MP4_2531803524864559001.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \u2018Let\u2019s wait, the impact is clear, and the discussions have an impact, but let\u2019s be a bit more patient and understand what the measurements will be and then maybe we\u2019ll deal with it.\u2019 On Friday, UEFA announced this season\u2019s Champions League final would be moved from the Russian city of St Petersburg to French capital Paris. The venue for the showpiece event has now been moved three years in a row, with the coronavirus pandemic the reason for the previous two rearrangements. Asked if he agrees with UEFA\u2019s decision, Tuchel said: \u2018Yes, and sadly it\u2019s the worst reason to change a location.

LAS VEGAS \u2014 Ukraine boxer Viktor Postol's \"family is in the middle of everything\" at home, days away from his fight against highly-rated Gary Antuanne Russell at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.Postol and Russell collide in a super featherweight bout scheduled for 10 rounds during the seven-bout Premier Boxing Champions event that Showtime will broadcast from 7 p.m. PT.The fight week featured animated athletes at the final pre-fight press conference Insider attended Thursday and fighters eager to rehydrate and compete after Friday's weigh-in.There is the main event with title shot ramifications between Chris Colbert and Hector Garcia and an IBF super flyweight championship between Jerwin Ancajas and Fernando Martinez.But Postol's story hits different as Russia this week invaded his home country Ukraine.Kyiv is besieged, as the defense ministry called on residents to \"make Molotov cocktails\" to fight Russians, who advance on the capital, as Insider recently reported.\"The situation in Ukraine has escalated a lot, and it's hard not to think about it,\" Postol told reporters this week.\"I'm working on focusing on the fight. My family is in the middle of everything, but they are safe, and that's what is most important.\"Showtime Sports President Stephen Espinoza told Insider that \"it's unimaginable\" how distracting it must be for Postol.\"Rarely, in fights, is there a distraction of this magnitude where a home country and, more personally, where a family is at risk,\" Espinoza told us.\"And so as a father, as a husband, as a son, I'm sure his thoughts have to be on what's going on over there. It is human nature.\"But with a professional, like Postol who's been in with some of the best division, to the extent that you can compartmentalize that, he'll do that.\"He added: \"He's been in tough situations before, but I can't imagine one that's personally much tougher than this one.\"Speaking to Boxing Scene, Postol called the news \"upsetting\" and \"difficult\" because \"it's been escalating for a couple days. There's nothing good about it.\"But Postol, whose nickname is 'Iceman,' is trying to live \u2014 for the next 24 hours at least \u2014 with \"a cold heart.\"He said: \"I understand that if I go home now, today, it's not gonna change anything. I have my people in my home country that take care of my family.

I'm stamping it on Saturday night.\"I'm going to give a show like I've always done \u2026 to be the next rising superstar. That's part of our plan.\"I've believed it all along, and now that other people are starting to see it, we're getting that much closer to our goal. The plan is to keep the knockout streak going. Execution is always our goal.\"Postol, who has esteemed coach Freddie Roach in his career, is unfazed.On the veteran boxing trainer Roach, who has trained dozens of world champion boxers including Manny Pacquiao, Postol said: \"He's always able to give me the right adjustments in training and during the fight.\u00a0\"It helps with my confidence even more.\"He added: \"I feel young and strong. I believe in myself. I'm very confident that I will become world champion again. This fight is a step toward achieving that feat.\"Read the original article on Insider",

Ovechkin was speaking for the first time since Russian president Vladamir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday morning. The 36-year-old described the situation as \u201cscary moments\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t know yet whether his family \u2014 including his parents, wife and young son \u2014 will remain in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard situation.

Russian tennis stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev have both shared messages asking for the war to end while Ukrainian NBA players Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Alex Len condemned the attacks, calling the situation \u201ca great tragedy.\u201d Russia\u2019s sporting community has also seen swift punishment from federations around the world. On Friday, UEFA pulled May\u2019s Champions League final from the country while Formula 1 effectively cancelled the upcoming Russian Grand Prix. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) urged sports federations to cancel or move events scheduled to be hosted by Russia, and the International Ice Hockey Federation announced it would hold a special meeting next week to determine how it would respond. Ovechkin has openly shown support for Putin in the past, including on social media \u2013 where he has a photo of himself with the Russian president as his profile picture. Ovechkin was asked about that relationship Friday and \u201cit\u2019s a hard situation for both sides.\u201d \u201cWell, he is my president. But how I said, I am not in politics. I am an athlete and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cEverything I hope is going to end. I\u2019m not in control of this situation.\u201d",

        "content": "The Capitals star broke his silence after not speaking with the media on Thursday.View the original article to see embedded media.After electing to not speak with the media on Thursday, Capitals superstar Alexander Ovechkin\u00a0broke his silence on Friday to address the ongoing conflict between Russia, his homeland, and Ukraine.Washington made the Russian-born team captain available to speak following practice for the first time since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a military strike on the eastern European country. Ovechkin, a well-documented Putin supporter, looked visibly distraught when asked for his thoughts on the crisis.\u00a0\u201cObviously, it's a hard situation. I have lots of friends in Russia and Ukraine and it's hard to see the war. I hope soon it's going to be over and there's going to be peace in the whole world,\u201d he told reporters.Ovechkin was then asked if he still supports Putin despite the outcry from around the world. The 36-year-old notably started a social movement in 2017 aimed to drive support for the heavily-criticized politician.\u00a0\u201cWell, he is my president, but I am not in politics,\u201d Ovechkin replied. \u201cI am an athlete, and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon. It\u2019s hard situation right now for both sides and everything, like how I said, everything I hope is going to be end. I\u2019m not in control of this situation.\u201dAlthough Ovechkin did not denounce Putin, his stance on the crisis itself echoed the sentiment shared by many athletes from around the world who have already spoken out.\u00a0When asked if there was a message he'd like share, Ovechkin quickly spoke up.\u201cPlease, no more war. It doesn't matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries,\u00a0I think we live in a world, like, we have to live in peace and a great world.\u201dMore Sports Illustrated Coverage:F1: It\u2018s \u2018Impossible\u2019 to Hold Russian Grand Prix Given \u2018Current Circumstances\u2019Ukrainian Tennis Player Dayana Yastremska Posts Heartbreaking Instagram PictureUkrainian Boxing Great Vitali Klitschko Says He\u2019s \u2018Prepared to Fight\u2019 Russian ForcesUEFA Moves Champions League Final From Russia to Paris",

I know these few lines won't make a big difference to the current situation but I just wanted to share it.\"Sivakov, who started his season with a top-10 finish at the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, said on Instagram he has recovered from a COVID infection and is back training after a week off the bike.",

        "content": "Chad Martz has spent the last few days in a mountainous region of western Ukraine purchasing food and basic supplies for those who\u2019ve fled their homes due to the Russian invasion of the country. But the Canadian citizen, who has been in the country for months due to his work with a British Columbia aid organization, isn\u2019t currently going anywhere himself. \u201cThe area that I\u2019m in \u2026 hasn\u2019t received any attacks, so it\u2019s been staying relatively calm,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be pretty drastic for us to to leave. We\u2019re in a very good position to provide the much needed care to people who are leaving everything.\u201d Martz, his Ukrainian wife and their teenage daughter travelled to Ukraine in July as part of their work with Hungry For Life, an aid group based in Chilliwack, B.C. Martz said he\u2019s been travelling to Ukraine regularly for the last 18 years. The ongoing bombings of roads and bridges since Russian began its invasion of Ukraine this week have made it difficult for people to travel from the country\u2019s capital of Kyiv and other areas in eastern and northern Ukraine to the area where Martz is, in the Carpathian Mountains, he said. But the numbers of those seeking shelter has been growing steadily, he said, noting that people arriving in his community are hosted at local churches that have needed help securing supplies. \u201cWe\u2019re just coming in and providing the resources: food, blankets, bedding, mattresses, and supplying them so that they could be caring for those who are coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s changing from hour to hour or so, the numbers, yesterday, were like 60 (people) and then we were up to 130. And now, a few hours ago it was 200 people coming in. It just keeps ballooning.\u201d The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that more than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have left their country in less than 48 hours and many more are moving towards its borders. Martz said most expats have been looking for ways to get out of Ukraine or to move within the country to safer locations while others have chosen to shelter in their place. A spokesman for Global Affairs Canada said about 800 Canadians are currently living in Ukraine according to a registration service for Canadians abroad, but there might be more as registration is voluntary. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday his government has arranged for safe passage for Canadian citizens and permanent residents fleeing Ukraine at the country\u2019s land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. \u201cWe are urgently issuing travel documents for affected Canadians, permanent residents and their immediate family members,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe are launching a new dedicated phone line for anyone at home or abroad with urgent Ukraine related immigration questions.\u201d Mykhailo Vynnytskyi, who was born and raised in Canada but has lived in Ukraine for 20 years, said he and his family have sought refuge in a rural area south of Kyiv. The 51-year-old was at home in Kyiv with his wife and four teenage children when friends reached out to say the family should consider leaving the city on Thursday morning, shortly after Russian troops began to invade. Vynnytskyi said the city was chaotic by 7:30 a.m. as residents started to flee. \u201cWe heard jets going overhead but we felt that we were relatively safe \u2026 we decided to wait for the traffic to die down,\u201d Vynnytskyi said in an interview on Thursday. The family left in the late afternoon and drove to their summer home about 120 kilometres south of Kyiv. The drive normally takes about an hour and half but with all the traffic it took them closer to four hours, Vynnytskyi said. \u201cAnybody that had the opportunity to leave, there was a fairly good chance that they were leaving,\u201d he said. Vynnytskyi said he has been able to keep in touch with his mother and brother who live in Canada. The author and professor said he\u2019s proud of what the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been able to do thus far but said the country needs more help. For now, his family is taking things day by day. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had war come to us this close so there\u2019s a certain amount of apprehension and fear at times \u2026 but at the end of the day this wasn\u2019t something that was shocking to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for something like this to happen. We weren\u2019t exactly prepared to have this extent of an invasion but an invasion was coming for the last month or so.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 25, 2022.

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.Associated Press Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many fake and misleading videos are spreading online. Some TikTok users are lifting other creators' audios and stitching them to irrelevant footage. The researcher Abbie Richards said in a video that people should check every audio they listen to. Fake and misleading videos of Russia invading Ukraine are spreading on TikTok, with specific explosion and screaming sounds gaining traction and being used by people attaching them to misleading footage.Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a land, sea, and air assault against Ukraine on early Thursday morning, the internet has ignited with solidarity messages, surreal memes attacking Russia, and pictures and videos depicting the scene.Among these videos spreading across the web are fake or otherwise manipulated ones.\u00a0Many users on TikTok and other platforms have created videos using footage from the past and claiming that it shows what is happening in Ukraine.One video, first discovered by the disinformation researcher Abbie Richards, has gained over 6 million views in less than a day. The video shows a dark skyline and then someone running through a house. The audio, which has since been removed, included a couple of people yelling \"oh my god\" and then a loud explosion.\u00a0The audio appears to have originated from a 2020 YouTube video depicting an explosion in Lebanon, according to Richards.Another recently uploaded TikTok showing a parachuting soldier gained over 20 million views, with many comments referencing the invasion in Ukraine, although a person with an identical handle had shared it on their Instagram in April 2016, according to NBC's Ben Collins.\u00a0\"Videos with altered context, like this one, are known as cheapfakes,\" Collins wrote on Twitter.Other creators have misused TikTok's audio functionality \u2014 where any creator can take another video's soundtrack, and which is most often used for lip sync videos and comedy skits \u2014 and produced TikToks with misleading explosion and screaming noises.One audio, which was initially used in a video on February 14, has been used in other, inauthentic videos with millions of views. The six-second audio features a rapid spree of gunshot sounds and people screaming in the background.One of the most popular videos using the audio has gained over 3 million views in less than 4 hours since it was published on Thursday morning. The video shows a plane flying out of control in the sky and on-screen text, translated from Indonesian, that says \"russian plane hit by ukraine soldiers\" and a crying-laughing emoji.\u00a0An example of a TikTok creator taking another user's audio and claiming it is authentic.Screenshot/TikTokThe same creator has made other videos about the invasion appropriating other users' audios, including one with over 26,000 views that uses an audio from November 2021 that appears to show a child screaming in fear.Another user's audio \u2014 an 11-second soundtrack with a few explosion noises \u2014 has been used in over 580 videos. The original video, which has over 28 million views and shows a flash of light and color bursting in the distant horizon, appears to be an authentic clip.\u00a0Many of the videos using its audio are just screen captures and reuploads of the original video, but there are also videos that take the audio and stitch it to another unrelated scene, apparently with the intent to gain clicks.\u00a0One of these clips has over 45,000 views and depicts a few trees; another one shows a house and a gray sky, and the camera judders as soon as an explosion sound occurs. A common theme between these fake videos is a shaky camera, which makes the clip appear chaotic or more \"realistic.\"Fake or misleading clips are also spreading on other platforms.\u00a0On Facebook, a now-deleted post accrued at least 19,000 views featuring a number of clips that it claimed portrayed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But at least two of the clips in the post were not from this month, while another was from a YouTube trailer video for the game \"War Thunder,\" according to the fact-checking organization Full Fact.Richards created a TikTok video on Thursday sharing the misinformation trends she'd noticed and advice on how to spot inauthentic videos.\u00a0 @tofology \u266c original sound - Abbie Richards \ud83d\udeab\u26f3\ufe0f \"Some videos are using scary audios from other videos to make it look like they're in the middle of conflict when they aren't,\" she said. \"Check and make sure that the audio is from the video that you're watching.\"Viewers can click on the audio tag at the bottom of the screen to see where that audio originates.Richards added that \"not all the footage\" is necessarily relevant and could be reposted from a long time ago and to be vigilant.TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.Read the original article on Insider",

It doesn\u2019t matter who is in the war \u2014 Russia, Ukraine, different countries \u2014 I think we live in a world, like, we have to live in peace and a great world,\u201d Ovechkin said. Ovechkin was speaking for the first time since Russian president Vladamir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday morning. The 36-year-old described the situation as \u201cscary moments\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t know yet whether his family \u2013 including his parents, wife and young son \u2013 will remain in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard situation. I have family back in Russia and it is scary moments,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do anything. We just hope it going to be end soon and everything is going to be all right.\u201d Reaction to the invasion has been swift around the world, including amongst other athletes. Russian tennis stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev have both shared messages asking for the war to end while Ukrainian NBA players Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Alex Len condemned the attacks, calling the situation \u201ca great tragedy.\u201d Russia\u2019s sporting community has also seen swift punishment from federations around the world. On Friday, UEFA pulled May\u2019s Champions League final from the country while Formula 1 effectively cancelled the upcoming Russian Grand Prix. The International Olympic Committee urged sports federations to cancel or move events scheduled to be hosted by Russia, and the International Ice Hockey Federation announced it would hold a special meeting next week to determine how it would respond. Ovechkin has openly shown support for Putin in the past, including on social media \u2013 where he has a photo of himself with the Russian president as his profile picture. Ovechkin was asked about that relationship Friday and \u201cit\u2019s a hard situation for both sides.\u201d \u201cWell, he is my president. But how I said, I am not in politics. I am an athlete and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cEverything I hope is going to end.

        "content": "The UCI joined the IOC and other sports federations in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, issuing a press release on Friday that called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. They did not take any other definitive action, incorrectly stating* that there are no UCI-sanctioned events scheduled in Russia in 2022.The UCI said the Russian invasion is a violation of the Olympic Truce, which is intended to promote peace and understanding through sport. The United Nations' member countries - including Russia - on December 2, 2021.The truce calls for the \u200b\u200bcessation of any hostilities between countries from February 4 through March 20, seven days after the Paralympics ends, to ensure athletes' can safely travel to and from the Games taking place in Beijing.\"The sport and cycling have often been able to lead the way to peace and dialogue,\" the UCI press release stated.\"These values must inspire the Russian government so that it can cease hostilities and resume dialogue to give a chance for a peaceful resolution of this military action.\"The move follows the UEFA announcement that the Champions League Finals would be moved out of Russia, taking place in Saint-Denis, France rather than Saint Petersburg as previously planned. After Sebastian Vettel stated he would not compete in the Sochi Formula 1 round in September, F1 cancelled the Russian round altogether.At the UAE Tour, the role of sport in the conflict was highlighted when Mathias Vacek, racing in the colours of Gazprom-RusVelo, won the stage. The team's sponsor is state owned by Russia and is a major supporter of international sport. The FC Schalke 04 football team announced it would remove Gazprom from their jerseys after the invasion and one of the Gazprom executives who was on the team's board of directors stepped down. The Haas Formula 1 team said it will remove branding of title sponsor Uralkali, a Russian fertilizer exporter, from its cars this weekend.The UCI stated it \"is following the development of the situation in Ukraine with concern and firmly condemns the violation of international law and of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity,\" and called for \"an immediate halt to hostilities and considers that the only way forward is through diplomatic channels\".There is no indication that the UCI is considering excluding Gazprom-RusVelo from the final UAE Tour stage or any races. The team itself has made no statement about the invasion or even a mention of it on its official channels.The UCI also made no mention of the presence of Russian oligarch Igor Makarov on its management committee, a billionaire on the US Treasury Department's 'Putin List' of individuals with close ties to Vladimir Putin.The UCI did, however, say it has raised the Ukrainian flag in front of its Aigle headquarters in solidarity with \"the innocent civilians faced with this terrible conflict\" and said their \"thoughts are with the Ukrainian people as well as Ukraine\u2019s cycling community, which it assures has its full support and affection.\"*Two track events, the Grand Prix Moscow and Grand Prix of Saint Petersburg are scheduled to take place in May, both are currently listed on the UCI's web site as sanctioned Class 2 events, as is the Five Rings of Moscow, set for June, is a 2.2-ranked road stage race.",

        "content": "The Simpsons has been praised for its ability to seemingly predict the future in the past, but in an interview with\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter, showrunner Al Jean admitted that a resurfaced clip of the animated series from back in 1998 that's lining up with current world events has left him feeling \"very sad.\"\"In terms of predictions, there are two kinds we have: The trivial, like Don Mattingly getting in trouble for his hair in 'Homer at the Bat,' and then there are predictions like this,\" the 61-year-old animator explained, speaking specifically about the \"Simpson Tide\" episode, in which Homer unintentionally fires the captain of a nuclear submarine out of the vessel and into Russian waters.Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesLater in the show, we see Russia revealing that the Soviet Union \"never truly dissolved\" as tanks and troops take over the streets and the Berlin Wall finds itself being rebuilt. \"I hate to say it, but I was born in 1961, so 30 years of my life were lived with the spectre of the Soviet Union. So, to me, this is sadly more the norm than it is a prediction. We just figured things were going to go bad,\" Jean went on.\"Historical aggression never really goes away, and you have to be super vigilant,\" the Michigan-born father of two told\u00a0THR. \"In 1998, when this clip aired, it was maybe the zenith of U.S.-Russia relations.

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video apparently shot in Kiev, defying rumors that he had fled the city Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "The Ukrainian president says he\u2019s still in the city of Kiev and \u201cdefending our independence\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a new video online on Friday evening, apparently filmed on the streets of Kiev. Surrounded by his aides, Zelensky told the camera that his team are \u201call here\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital \u201cdefending our independence.\u201d An earlier video by Zelensky was shot in what appeared to be a bunker, fueling rumors that he had fled the city or country amid Russia\u2019s military assault. Zelensky\u2019s latest video was posted to social media shortly after darkness fell in Kiev on Friday, though its location and time of filming have not been verified. Earlier, Russian troops continued their advance on the city, approaching its outskirts from multiple directions and capturing a key airfield where the Ukrainian military claimed to have turned back the advance only hours earlier. Zelensky posts a video with top aides + his prime minister, apparently from above ground in Kyiv. \u201cWe are all here, our soldiers are here \u2026 we are defending our independence\u201d pic.twitter.com/CX7s7Rq0ED\u2014 Felix Light (@felix_light) February 25, 2022 As the Russian attack continues, Ukrainian officials have taken to arming civilians and removing age caps for entry into the country\u2019s military. However, in addition to arming the populace and signaling defiance, Zelensky said earlier on Friday that he is willing to \u201csit at the negotiation table to stop human fatalities.\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described Zelensky\u2019s statement as \u201cpositive,\u201d and Moscow has offered to negotiate with Kiev, as long as Ukraine disarms, neutralizes, and drops its aspirations of membership in the NATO alliance. On Thursday, Zelensky gave a televised address from a secure bunker. Describing himself as \u201ctarget number one\u201d of the Russian military, Zelensky said that his family was at an undisclosed location. His swapping of the presidential palace for the bunker sparked rumors that he had fled west to the city of Lvov, or out of the country entirely. Russia's\u00a0military offensive on Ukraine began early on Thursday following requests from the newly recognized Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR) People\u2019s Republics for aid under their mutual treaties with Moscow. The two claimed that they were facing an imminent all-out attack,\u00a0though Kiev insisted it was not planning to retake the area by force. Putin\u00a0said the military\u00a0action was the only\u00a0option left after Kiev abandoned the internationally-brokered Minsk agreements, which not only required it to observe a ceasefire, but also to give the Donbass region more autonomy.",

        "content": "Fighting-age men were said to have been forced out of their cars (Picture: Manny Marotta/PA Wire) An American who walked for 20 hours with thousands of Ukrainian refugees has revealed how fighting-age men were dragged from their screaming families to join the increasingly vain fight against Russia. Manny Marrotta, 25, from Pennsylvania, said he had been in the western city of Lviv working as a freelance journalist for 10 days when Putin announced his invasion on Thursday. He joined a mass of civilians fleeing to the Polish border 43 miles away in the afternoon after waking up to the sound of an air raid siren and hearing rumours of an impending bombing. With trains fully booked and car hires and public buses suspended, he made a \u2018desperate\u2019 decision to begin walking west on what would prove to be a \u2018harrowing\u2019 treak. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live He described scenes amounting to a \u2018humanitarian nightmare\u2019 as men, women and children packed the roads in buses, cars and on foot. Mr Marrotta said: \u2018You had elderly people walking alone on the side of the road with these sticks, hobbling along. \u2018There was one grandmother that told me she was going to Poland \u2013 Poland was far away, it\u2019s amazing the result of these people (trying) to escape.\u2019 \u2018It was about 10, 15 kilometres from the border and Ukrainian army soldiers started coming out onto the streets with speakers, announcing \u201cno Ukrainian man aged 18 to 60 is allowed to leave the country \u2013 you must go east and fight\u201d\u2018. Lviv Station was awash with stranded refugees after trains became fully booked (Picture: PA) A vast queue of cars is crawling towards the Polish border (Picture: PA) The Ukrainian government has announced conscription, meaning healthy adult men must enlist in the armed forces. \u2018They were saying, \u201csay goodbye to your girlfriend, to your wife, say goodbye to your mothers and daughters, you\u2019re going east\u201d. \u2018I started seeing these surreal scenes of fathers saying, \u201d don\u2019t want to leave my family,\u201d and Ukrainian soldiers yanking them away \u2026 Mothers were protesting, they were screaming: \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d \u2018There was this guy standing up on a box saying \u201cforget your wives, forget about your girlfriends \u2013 you need to defend your country.

        "content": "The Government of India will ensure evacuation of all Indian nationals from war-hit Ukraine, informed Indian Ambassador to Ukraine Partha Satpathy on Friday, February 25. He was assuring students who were stranded in the country a day after Russia launched a military operation\u00a0against Ukraine. The ambassador implored the students who have taken refuge in temporary shelters to be \"realistic about the situation\" and, in turn, do their bit to assure family and friends back home that everything would be fine. He was seen saying this in a video that was shared by a student, as stated in a report by PTI. Due to Russia's military operation in Ukraine, the Indian students who were pursuing their higher education, especially medicine, in Ukraine are vexed and have been appealing to authorities for their safe evacuation.\u00a0 \u0093The government of India is completely seized with the matter. Every Indian will go back home. Planes are being lined up. Personnel is being lined up, but it's a warzone. We will have to work out the logistics and find the modalities to reach the West,\u0094 Satpathy said while speaking to students who are stuck there, as quoted in a report by PTI. Through Ukraine's land border crossings with its neighbouring countries, the Government of India is planning the evacuation of students, the ambassador informed. Two Air India flights from the Romanian capital Bucharest are being arranged for evacuation.\u00a0 Also, in coordination with embassies in the neighbouring countries, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Government of India, the vehicle movement has started. The plan is to send the first batch of students through Romania, the ambassador explained.\u00a0 In an advisory issued by the embassy earlier, Indians in Ukraine were being asked to stay \"strong, safe and alert\".\u00a0 On February 24, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla shared that out of the 20,000 Indian nationals stuck in Ukraine, 4,000 have returned to India.",

        "description": "The Russian economy has taken another dive as a single ruble is currently worth less than the in-game currency for Roblox.",
        "content": "Russia is still dealing with sanctions imposed on it about eight years ago (pic: Roblox) The Russian economy has taken another dive as a single ruble is currently worth less than the in-game currency for Roblox. As a result of its invasion of Ukraine, multiple countries have imposed sanctions on Russia or are at least planning to, such as banning Russia from using the Swift payment system. This would cut Russia off from most international transactions and make it harder for it to move or trade its money. Basically, the aim is to damage Russia\u2019s economy, which has already been declining for some time even before the invasion. Its main stock index only dived further on Thursday after the invasion began, and it\u2019s been noted that the country\u2019s money is now worth less than Robux, the in-game currency found in Roblox, a popular online platform where users, mostly children, can create their own video games. As spotted on Reddit, a single Robux, which is used to purchase in-game items and can be converted into real money, is worth approximately $0.012 (think less than a penny over here). By comparison, the ruble is currently equivalent to about $0.011. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live In order to stop the market from crashing, the Russian central bank stepped in to prop up the ruble. Although the Russian government insists that it has enough financial resources to \u2018maintain the financial system in the light of sanctions and external threats\u2019 (via Yahoo Finance), the fact that the bank had to step in at all suggests the situation is rather dire. What doesn\u2019t help is that Russia has never fully recovered from the sanctions imposed on it after it annexed Crimea in 2014, an act that served as the prelude to the current invasion. However, some believe Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s irrational actions mean sanctions won\u2019t be enough to deter him.

Since then, foreign secretary Liz Truss told Russia\u2019s ambassador that it faced further, severe sanctions for repeatedly lying about Russia\u2019s intentions and apparently kicked him out of the meeting.

        "content": "The striker received Ukrainian citizenship in 2019 and appeared in a video in which players appealed to the Brazilian government for help Brazil-born striker Junior Moraes could be conscripted by the Ukrainian army under an order by the country's President,\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that men cannot leave the country following Russia's invasion \u2013 little more than a day after the Shakhtar Donetsk star pleaded to the Brazilian government to help him flee his adopted homeland. Two-time Ukrainian Premier League top scorer Moraes joined a group of Brazilian players based in Ukraine who asked for\u00a0assistance to leave the country after\u00a0Zelenskyy declared martial law on Thursday. In a post shared with his Instagram following of more than 235,000, Moraes was quoted as saying:\u00a0\u201cThe situation is one of despair. I ask you to disclose this video so that it reaches the government. \u201cBorders are closed, banks, there is no fuel \u2013 there will be a shortage of food, there is no money. We are gathered waiting for a plan to leave Ukraine.\u201d Zelensky has since banned\u00a0male citizens\u00a0aged between 18 and 60 from leaving Ukraine as part of a full military mobilization lasting for 90 days. As a naturalized Ukrainian, Moraes could be required to report to a military institution for duty. The 34-year-old has spent the majority of his career in Ukraine, including prolific spells with the club he joined in 2012, Metalurh Donetsk, and Dynamo Kiev between 2015 and 2018. Moraes has won the Ukrainian Premier League twice since joining Shakhtar in 2018, earning citizenship within two weeks of filing his application in March 2019. He made his Ukraine debut against Portugal that year\u00a0and has earned ten caps since, scoring his first international goal against Finland in a World Cup qualifier in 2021.

Sharing a photo of his children praying at a table in Brazil, where they are based with his wife, Moraes wrote: \"My reason to continue. Please still pray for us.\" The Ukrainian Premier League was suspended on Thursday for at least a month.",

        "content": "Amidst Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev pens an anti-war message on the camera lens at the Dubai Tennis Championships.TSN/Twitter Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev booked his spot in the Dubai Tennis Championships title match. After winning his match Friday, the top-10 player wrote \"No war please\" on the TV camera lens. His message promoting peace comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensified late in the week. Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev has a message for the world \u2014 and maybe one directed at his own country.\"No war please.\"On Friday, the 24-year-old Moscow native called for peace on Friday after besting Poland's Hubert Hurkacz for a spot in the Dubai Tennis Championships title match. As is a popular tennis tradition, Rublev wrote a note on the TV camera lens following his victory.Instead of signing his name or sketching a cheeky doodle \u2014 as is the norm in the sport \u2014 the world No. 7 penned a serious message for all to see: \"No war please.\"\u2014TSN (@TSN_Sports) February 25, 2022Rublev's appeal against violence came as his home nation ramped up its invasion into neighboring country Ukraine late in the week. And as the young star was playing his match Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces attacked Ukraine's capital of Kyiv in what is considered Europe's most serious ground war since World War II.Ukraine is now in serious jeopardy of falling into Russian control.Rublev's message was not the first to come out of the sports world this week. Ukrainian athletes have been vocal in their opposition to Putin's antics, with one soccer player going so far as to unveil a \"No War in Ukraine\" undershirt after scoring a goal in a Europa League game.Russian President Vladimir Putin at the 2022 Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies.Getty/Alexei DruzhininAnd the efforts don't stop at individual athletes; sports' largest institutions have taken measures to distance themselves from Putin and Russia, who are widely seen as the aggressors in the Ukrainian conflict and have become global pariahs as a result. In the days immediately following Russia's onslaught, Formula One cancelled the 2022 Russian Grand Prix, UEFA moved the Champions League Final from St. Petersburg to Paris, the ATP Tour dropped a competition in Moscow, and franchises have rapidly abandoned Russian sponsors.The reaction across the sports world has been swift, but the political world's response does not appear to have deterred Putin from the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. The result will likely have dire consequences across the globe.Insider's live blog of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0is covering developments as they happen.Read the original article on Insider",

The Kremlin\u2019s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered new sanctions from Europe and the US, and has also cast a doubt over several scientific collaborations with Russia, particularly in space. Following the invasion, scientists in Russia swiftly circulated the letter, which was then published on TrV-Nauka \u2013 an independent Russian science news site. The letter states that having unleashed war, Russia has \u201cdoomed itself\u201d to international isolation and to the position of a \u201cpariah country\u201d. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-3759129-1'); }); \u201cThis means that we, scientists, will no longer be able to do our job normally: after all, conducting scientific research is unthinkable without full cooperation with colleagues from other countries,\u201d the letter states, adding that the isolation would result in further \u201ccultural and technological degradation\u201d of Russia with the war with Ukraine representing a \u201cstep to nowhere\u201d. \u201cWe respect Ukrainian statehood, which rests on really working democratic institutions,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe treat the European choice of our neighbours with understanding. We are convinced that all problems in relations between our countries can be resolved peacefully.\u201d The letter ends by calling for an \u201cimmediate halt\u201d to the operation against Ukraine. \u201cWe demand respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe demand peace for our countries. Let\u2019s do science, not war!\u201d Space programmes Russia\u2019s increasing international isolation could also impact international collaborations. Following the announcement by US president Joe Biden of a tranche of new sanctions, NASA issued a media release stating that it was continuing to work with all international partners, including the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos, for the \u201congoing safe operations\u201d of the International Space Station. \u201cThe new export control measures will continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation,\u201d the release continued. \u201cNo changes are planned to the agency\u2019s support for ongoing in orbit and ground station operations\u201d. Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin took a similarly measured line, noting on Twitter that \u201cNASA confirmed its willingness to continue to cooperate with Roscosmos\u201d before adding that \u201cwe continue to analyse the new US sanctions to detail our response\u201d. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, however, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned the future of scientific collaborations with Russia. \u201cI\u2019ve been broadly in favour of continuing artistic and scientific collaboration,\u201d noted Johnson. \u201cBut in the current circumstances, it\u2019s hard to see how even those can continue as normal.\u201d Several European-led missions are scheduled to be launched via Russian-built rockets later this year or in 2023. The Rosalind Franklin rover, previously known as the ExoMars rover, is currently scheduled to take off in September from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan via a Proton-M rocket. Designed to seek out evidence of past life on Mars, it is a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos. An artist\u2019s impression of the ExoMars rover on the surface of Mars. (Courtesy: ESA/ATG medialab) The orbital dynamics of Earth and Mars mean that launch windows only open for a short period every two years, to take advantage of the two planets\u2019 closest approach to one another. The rover\u2019s launch has already been delayed from 2020 to 2022 amid parachute and electronics difficulties and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If it launches in September, it would reach Mars by April 2023 at the earliest, but additional postponements could mean a further two-year delay. ESA is also expected to launch the \u20ac500m Euclid mission via a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2023 from Kourou in French Guiana. Euclid is designed to explore the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter, using a 1.2 m diameter telescope, a camera and a spectrometer to plot a 3D map of the distribution of more than two billion galaxies \u2013 a view that will stretch across 10 billion light-years, revealing details of the universe\u2019s structure and its expansion. ESA director general Josef Aschbacher took to Twitter to say he is \u201csad and worried as the aggression continues to worsen in Ukraine\u201d and that they are continuing to monitor the \u201cevolving\u201d situation. \u201cCivil space cooperation remains a bridge,\u201d noted Aschbacher. \u201cESA continues to work on all of its programmes, including on ISS & ExoMars launch campaign, in order to honour commitments with member states & partners\u201d. He adds that ESA member states will take \u201cany decisions needed\u201d. \u201cBut for now, support for our missions & colleagues continues until further notice.\u201d Meanwhile, the Germany Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF, noted that it is to stop all science and research collaboration with Russia, as well as vocational education and training. International decisions The Russian invasion is also having an impact on international meetings. The International Congress of Mathematicians 2022 (ICM) is currently scheduled to be held in St. Petersburg from 6-14 July, but several mathematical societies have called for the International Mathematical Union (IMU), which is responsible for the event, to cancel. The London Mathematical Society, for example, says it no longer plans to send delegates to the ICM. \u201cThe Society strongly recommends that the IMU not hold the ICM in Russia in July 2022,\u201d it noted in a statement. \u201cThe IMU has been approached by several societies and individuals who raise serious and understandable concerns about the consequences of the conflict for the ICM,\u201d the IMU said in a statement. \u201cThe executive committee of the IMU is now assessing the situation, and will make a decision as soon as possible regarding how to proceed. We will communicate this decision to our members once it has been made without delay.\u201d The post Russian scientists condemn Ukraine invasion as international projects and meetings thrown into doubt appeared first on Physics World.",

        "content": "The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis: MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says prospects for possible peace talks between Russia and Ukraine look uncertain due to apparent differences over a venue. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to send a delegation for talks with Ukrainian officials in Minsk, Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko runs a pro-Russian government. That agreement came in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s offer earlier in the day to discuss non-aligned status for Ukraine. Peskov told reporters that after the parties discussed Minsk as a possible venue, Ukrainian officials changed course and said they were unwilling to travel to Minsk and would prefer to meet in NATO member Poland. They then halted further communication, Peskov said. Putin has claimed that the western refusal to heed Russia\u2019s demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order an invasion of the neighboring country. ___ PRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s transport minister says his country has banned all Russian airlines from Czech airports, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Martin Kupka said Friday the ban covers all regular flights between Prague and Moscow and Prague and St. Petersburg, as well as charter flights. Russian planes will also be banned from landing at the western Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary, a popular destination for Russian tourists. The measure becomes affective at midnight. Additionally, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his country will stop issuing visas for Russian citizens and will urge other European Union countries to do the same. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Major retail chains in Lithuania started to remove Russian and Belarusian products from shelves, a move joined by online shops and widely applauded by the public as a protest against Moscow\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine. Maxima LT, the largest chain in the Baltic nations, said Friday the Russian goods it sells are mainly alcohol, dried products and candy, amounting to millions of euros (dollars) in sales. Other retailers like drug stores and home suppliers made similar announcements. The Lithuanian postal service said it will not be distributing any more Russian periodicals. International companies such as IKEA are facing pressure to remove Russian-made goods from sale in the small Baltic country, which fears Russian aggression. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed his troops for their courage as they press their offensive across Ukraine and bear down on Kyiv. Speaking during Friday\u2019s meeting of his Security Council, Putin claimed that most Ukrainian military units are reluctant to engage Russian forces. He said the units offering resistance are mostly volunteer battalions made up of right-wing Ukrainian nationalists. He offered no evidence for his claims, which could not be independently verified. Echoing an earlier Russian military statement, Putin accused Ukrainian forces of deploying heavy weapons in urban areas in several big cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, to use civilians as shields. The Russian president urged the Ukrainian military to end their resistance and turn on their leaders. ___ WARSAW, Poland \u2013 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is in Warsaw for urgent talks with NATO\u2019s nine eastern flank members on how to enhance the region\u2019s security, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The participants were also due to remotely join a NATO summit in Brussels. Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda, hosting the talks between the so-called NATO Bucharest Nine, in his opening speech said that \u201cdemons of a great war, unseen since 1945\u201d have returned to Europe. NATO\u2019s eastern flank members fear Moscow could also target them. ___ FORT STEWART, Ga. \u2014 The U.S. Army says 3,800 soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia, are among additional forces deploying to Europe following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Troops from the Army post southwest of Savannah, Georgia, \u201cwill deploy to reassure NATO allies, deter further aggression against NATO member states and train with host-nation forces,\u201d Fort Stewart commanders said in a statement late Thursday. Fort Stewart is home to the Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division, which saw multiple combat deployments during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most of the 3rd Infantry soldiers heading to Europe are assigned to the division\u2019s 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team. \u201cThe Raider Brigade is trained and equipped to deter aggression and to reassure and defend our allies,\u201d Col. Pete Moon, the 1st Brigade\u2019s commander, said in prepared statement. The Georgia-based soldiers appear to be among 7,000 additional U.S. forces deploying to Germany to bolster NATO following the invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden ordered the deployments Thursday. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Chinese President Xi Jinping he\u2019s ready to send a delegation for talks with Ukrainian officials. The Kremlin said in its readout of Friday\u2019s call that Xi underlined that he \u201cviews the Russian leadership\u2019s action in the crisis situation with respect.\u201d In a reference to new Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, the Kremlin noted that Putin and Xi agreed \u201cit\u2019s inadmissible to use illegitimate sanctions for achieving selfish goals of certain countries.\u201d Chinese state TV reported that Xi emphasized that China \u201csupports Russia and Ukraine resolving the problem through negotiations.\u201d ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 Dozens of parents, relatives and friends of Indian students stranded in Ukraine held a demonstration near the Russian Embassy in New Delhi to demand the students\u2019 immediate evacuation. Police barricaded the roads leading to the embassy on Friday and asked the protesters to meet Indian Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the repatriation of nearly 16,000 Indians, including students. Some of the demonstrators held video conferencing calls with some of those stuck in metro trains and bomb shelters in Kyiv. \u201cWe are running low on food and water in a crowded bunker,\u201d one of the callers in Ukraine said. Indian Embassy officials are now traveling to border areas of Ukraine touching Poland, Romania Slovakia and Hungary to facilitate the exit of Indian nationals so that they can be evacuated to India, said foreign ministy official Harsh Vardhan Shringla. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 Germany\u2019s foreign minister said Friday that the European Union will take in all people fleeing Ukraine due to the current conflict. \u201cWe need to do everything to immediately take in the people who are now fleeing bombs, fleeing tanks, that\u2019s also what we\u2019ve been preparing for in recent weeks,\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Brussels. \u201cWe tried everything so this day wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it came because the Russian president chose it, opted for war and against human lives.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we will take in all of the people who are fleeing now,\u201d Baerbock said. \u201cWe will bring the people from Ukraine to safety.\u201d ___ BUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Moldova\u2019s national naval agency says a ship in \u201cneutral waters\u201d of the Black Sea has been hit by a missile, leaving two crew members seriously injured. The Naval Agency said in a statement that the source of the missile that hit the Moldova-flagged Millennial Spirit on Friday is unknown. \u201cA fire broke out onboard the ship; the equipment and lifeboats were destroyed,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThe ship\u2019s crew left the ship equipped only with life jackets.\u201d The agency said that the company that operates the tanker is a Ukrainian legal entity and the crew members are Russian citizens. Rescue operations were carried out by Ukrainian authorities, the Moldovan agency said. ___ LONDON \u2014 An expert in international trade says he thinks world leaders are reluctant to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system of financial transactions because it is the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of sanctions. Disconnecting Russia from SWIFT to try to force President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine would have major economic costs for western countries, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. Lee-Makiyama told the BBC that if Russia were cut off for foreign payments for its gas and oi,l it would quickly start expropriating the 300 billion euros EU investors have plowed into the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuclear option that it\u2019s going to basically exterminate yourself and your enemy,\u201d he said. World leaders, who have so far ruled out military intervention in Ukraine, have few good options for deterring Putin because he knows they fear a direct confrontation with Russia, Lee-Makiyama said. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says Russia is ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send the delegation in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s offer to discuss a non-aligned status for Ukraine. That indicates Zelenskyy would be willing to negotiate dropping his country\u2019s bid to join NATO, as Russia has demanded. Before the invasion, the West had rejected the demand. Putin claimed the refusal to discuss keeping Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order a military action in Ukraine to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it. ___ BANGKOK \u2014 Myanmar\u2019s ruling military council offered its support Friday for Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, while the shadow government leading opposition to army rule condemned Moscow\u2019s action. A statement by the spokesman for Myanmar\u2019s military government said Russia acted correctly to perpetuate its \u201csovereignty.\u201d A text message to Myanmar journalists from Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun also said the invasion demonstrated Russia\u2019s position as a \u201cworld power\u201d helping to keep global relations in balance. Myanmar\u2019s military rulers face armed domestic opposition, and like Russia\u2019s leaders now, are the target of strong sanctions from Western governments seeking a return to democratic rule. Myanmar\u2019s National Unity Government, established by lawmakers prevented from taking their seats when the army seized power in February last year, deplored Moscow\u2019s action. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Lithuania\u2019s Radio and Television Commission has temporarily suspended the operation of six Russian-language TV channels for their alleged incitement to war and propaganda. The six TV channels were taken off the air Friday Planeta RTR, Rossijya 24, Belarus 24, NTV Mir, RTR Planeta and Rossiya 24 were suspended for five years, and PBK and TVCI for three years, commission Vice Chairman Ricardas Slapsys told the Baltic News Service. Lithuania, the most southern of the three Baltic nations, borders Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region to the southwest, Belarus to the east, Latvia to the north and Poland to the south. Latvia banned several Russian television channels had their right to broadcast in Latvia suspended Thursday for several years. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military claims it has taken control of an airport just outside Kyiv, as Kremlin forces bear down on the Ukrainian capital. The claim could not be independently verified. Taking possession of the airport in Hostomel, which has a long runway allowing the landing of heavy-lift transport planes, would mean Russia can airlift troops directly to Kyiv\u2019s outskirts. Hostomel is just 7 kilometers (4 miles) northwest of the city. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that the Russian airborne forces used 200 helicopters to land in Hostomel and killed over 200 troops belonging to Ukraine\u2019s special forces. Konashenkov claimed that Russian troops suffered no casualties. That contradicts Ukrainian claims that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s Defense Ministry has confirmed media reports that it is deploying additional military assets to NATO\u2019s eastern flank. German weekly Der Spiegel reported that the deployments included 150 soldiers and about a dozen Boxer armored fighting vehicles, two ships and anti-missile systems. Ministry spokesman Christian Thiels declined to say Friday exactly how many soldiers were being deployed. But he confirmed that a navy corvette would leave Saturday for patrols in the Baltic while a frigate will be deployed in the Mediterranean, both under NATO command. Germany is also assessing whether to deploy Patriot anti-missile systems to an eastern European NATO country, Thiels said. Decisions on deploying further troops could be expected soon, he added. ___ BEIJING \u2014 Chinese state TV says Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that Moscow is willing to negotiate with Ukraine, even as Moscow\u2019s forces invade its neighbor. The report Friday followed a Kremlin announcement that Putin\u2019s government was considering an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate non-aligned status for his country. Putin said Moscow \u201cis willing to conduct high-level negotiations with the Ukrainian side,\u201d China Central Television reported on its website. It gave no indication whether Putin said he was responding to Zelenskyy\u2019s offer or gave any details of what the two sides might negotiate. Russia complains that the United States and its allies ignored Moscow\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns\u201d by expanding the NATO military alliance eastward, closer to Russia\u2019s borders. Xi said China \u201csupports Russia and Ukraine resolving the problem through negotiations,\u201d CCTV said. ___ ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey\u2019s foreign minister says officials are still assessing a request by Ukraine for Turkey to close to Russian shipping the straits at the entrance of the Black Sea. Mevlut Cavusoglu warned, however, that under a 1936 convention Ankara may not be able to deny total access to the Russian vessels. Ukraine on Thursday formally asked Turkey to close the Turkish Straits to Russian warships in line with the Montreux Convention which allows Turkey to restrict the passage of belligerent countries\u2019 warships during times of war. The convention stipulates however, that warships belonging to Black Sea coastal countries can return to their bases. \u201cIf there is a demand for the ships of the warring countries to return to their bases, then (passage) must be allowed,\u201d Cavusoglu was quoted as telling Hurriyet newspaper in an interview. The minister said Turkish experts were assessing if the current situation amounted to \u201ca state of war.\u201d ___ BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s president is appealing to Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201cstop the madness of this war now.\u201d President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in Berlin on Friday said that \u201cwe don\u2019t want enmity with the Russian people, quite the contrary, but this wrongdoing cannot go without a clear answer.\u201d Steinmeier, whose post is largely ceremonial but holds moral authority, said that Germany will do its part in deterring Putin from using force against its NATO allies. The president, who served twice as Germany\u2019s foreign minister, said that Putin \u201cshould not underestimate the strength of democracies\u201d and Germans shouldn\u2019t either. He said it\u2019s good that people are going out to demonstrate, adding: \u201cThe Russian president should not believe for a second that people in Germany and Europe simply accept this brutal violence.\u201d ___ VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis went to the Russian embassy in Rome on Friday to personally express his concern about the war in Ukraine, in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent. Popes usually receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican. For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of feeling about Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted \u201cclearly to express his concern about the war.\u201d Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said. Francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. But he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties. ___ GENEVA \u2014 The U.N. human rights office says it is receiving increasing reports of civilian casualties in Ukraine in the wake of Russia\u2019s military invasion. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says its staffers have so far verified at least 127 civilian casualties. They include 25 people killed and 102 injured, mostly from shelling and airstrikes. She cautioned Friday that the numbers are \u201cvery likely to be an underestimate.\u201d Shamdasani also said the rights office was \u201cdisturbed by the multiple arbitrary arrests\u201d of demonstrators in Russia who on Thursday protested against the conflict. \u201cWe understand more than 1,800 protesters were arrested,\u201d she said, before adding that it was unclear how many might have been released already. Meanwhile, spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo of the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said its latest update had that more than 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes in Ukraine. She said the agency\u2019s planning figures anticipated that \u201cup to 4 million people may flee to other countries if the situation escalates.\u201d ___ LONDON \u2014 Latvia\u2019s defense minister is criticizing European nations for failing to cut Russia off from the global bank payments network and refusing to provide weapons to help Ukraine defend itself. Artis Pabriks\u2019 comments came after the U.S. and European Union stopped short of blocking Russia\u2019s access to the SWIFT payments system when they announced a new round of sanctions late Thursday. Pabriks also chided fellow EU nations that have refused to provide \u201clethal aid\u201d to Ukraine, saying only the U.K., Greece, Poland and the Baltic states had done so. In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Pabriks suggested that many European leaders don\u2019t want to take these steps because they would cause economic hardship for their own countries. \u201cIf you are really not ready yourself to spill blood, at least spill money now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cDo it now, because if you lose Ukraine all European geopolitics will change. \u2026 There will be much more pressure on Poland, much more pressure on the Baltics.\u2019\u2019 The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia fear they could be the Kremlin\u2019s next target. ___ DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Syrian President Bashar Assad is praising Russia\u2019s military incursion into Ukraine and denouncing what he calls western \u201chysteria\u201d surrounding it. Assad spoke by phone Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWhat is happening today is a correction of history and a restoration of balance which was lost in the world after the breakup of the Soviet Union,\u201d Assad said, according to state-run news agency SANA. He said confronting NATO expansionism is Russia\u2019s right. Russia is a main backer of Assad\u2019s government and its military intervention in 2015 in the country\u2019s civil war helped tip the balance of power in his favor. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says it will analyze the Ukrainian president\u2019s offer to discuss a non-aligned status for his country, as a Russian military invasion pushes closer to Kyiv. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was ready to hold talks on the issue. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s offer, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday described it as \u201ca move in a positive direction.\u201d He said in a conference call with reporters that \u201cwe paid attention to that, and now we need to analyze it.\u201d But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Zelenskyy \u201cis simply lying\u201d when he offers to discuss non-aligned status for Ukraine. Lavrov said at a briefing that Zelenskyy \u201cmissed the opportunity\u201d to discuss a neutral status for Ukraine when Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed it. Putin says the West left him no option but to invade when it rejected Moscow\u2019s demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 A senior European Union official says the 27-nation bloc intends to slap further sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. EU Council president Charles Michel tweeted Friday: \u201cSecond wave of sanctions with massive and severe consequences politically agreed last night. Further package under urgent preparation.\u201d Michel announced the move after a call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Michel said Kyiv \u201cis under continued attack by Russian forces\u201d and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence. ___ BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary has extended temporary legal protection to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, as countries in eastern Europe prepare for the arrival of refugees at their borders. Hungary, which borders Ukraine to the west, has in the past taken a firm stance against all forms of immigration. It has controversially refused to accept refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But in a decree published late Thursday, Hungary\u2019s government announced that all Ukrainian citizens arriving from Ukraine, and all third-country nationals legally residing there, would be entitled to protection. The section applying to third-country nationals makes it possible for non-Ukrainians \u2014 for example, Belarussian refugees living in Ukraine \u2014 to receive protection in the European Union. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungary will play no part in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that it would accept refugees arriving at its borders. ___ LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his solidarity with Ukraine in telephone call with the country\u2019s leader. Johnson\u2019s Downing Street office said Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered an update on Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes. \u201cThe prime minister assured President Zelenskyy that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing,\u2019\u2019 Johnson\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cHe paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia\u2019s campaign of violence and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.\u2019\u2019 ___ BERLIN \u2014 The German government says it has suspended the granting of export credit and investment guarantees for business with Russia. The Economy Ministry said Friday that the granting of new export credit guarantees and investment guarantees for Russia was suspended on Thursday. The so-called Hermes credit export guarantees protect German companies from losses when exports aren\u2019t paid for. Investment guarantees are granted by the German government to protect direct investments by German companies from political risk in the countries where they are made. The Economy Ministry said that new export credit guarantees to the tune of 1.49 billion euros ($1.67 billion) were granted last year for business with Russia. New investment guarantees came in at a fraction of that amount, at 3.75 million euros ($4.2 million). ___ WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland\u2019s Border Guard says that some 29,000 people were cleared to enter through the country\u2019s land border with neighboring Ukraine on Thursday, the day Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began. Before that, there were some 12,000 average daily entries from Ukraine into European Union and NATO member Poland, through land, sea and airport checkpoints, according to Border Guard statistics. Poland has lifted the requirement of COVID-19 quarantine or vaccination certificates for refugees from Ukraine. A number of reception centers with camp beds, soup kitchens and medical care have been organized in locations close to the border with Ukraine. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China is holding back from labeling Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine an invasion. At the same time, it is upholding the sanctity of territorial sovereignty, in a nod to its own insistence that Taiwan is part of China. \u201cThe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and maintained,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday. \u201cAt the same time, we also see that the issue of Ukraine has its own complex and special historical merits, and we understand Russia\u2019s legitimate concerns on security issues,\u201d he added. Wang did not answer questions about whether China would recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, in Ukrainian territory claimed by Russia, as independent states. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s civil aviation authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation against the British government\u2019s ban on Aeroflot flights. Rosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday. It said the measure was taken in response to the \u201cunfriendly decisions\u201d by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military claims it has destroyed 118 Ukrainian military assets since the beginning of its assault on its neighbor and as it pushes into the outskirts of Kyiv. The claim could not be independently verified and was not confirmed by Ukraine amid a flurry of claims and counterclaims by each side. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that among the targets were 11 Ukrainian air bases, 13 command facilities, 36 air defense radars, 14 air defense missile systems, 5 warplanes, 18 tanks and warships. However, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace rejected Russian claims of success on the first day of its invasion of Ukraine, saying it had \u201cfailed to deliver\u201d on its day one objectives. Wallace told Sky News that the Western assessment is that Russia had failed to take its major objectives and is behind on its timetable for advance. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost over 450 personnel,\u2019\u2019 he said. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, calling it \u201ca deep cut in European history after the end of the Cold War.\u201d Germany\u2019s dpa news agency quoted Merkel saying Friday that there was \u201cno justification for this blatant attack of international law. I condemn it in the sharpest possible manner.\u201d Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and speaks Russian, was heavily engaged in negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout her 16 years in office, which ended in December. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy regulatory agency says that higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but didn\u2019t provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a \u201cdisturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air.\u201d Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle Thursday. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian airborne troops were protecting the plant to prevent any possible \u201cprovocations.\u201d He insisted that radiation levels in the area have remained normal. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been \u201cno casualties or destruction at the industrial site.\u201d The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks. ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says he is \u201cclosely following recent developments in and around Ukraine with increasing concern.\u201d Karim Khan warned \u201call sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine\u201d that Ukraine has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. That means \u201cmy office may exercise its jurisdiction over and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within the territory of Ukraine since 20 February 2014 onwards, Khan said in a statement Friday. Khan adds that because neither Russia nor Ukraine are member states of the court, his office does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in the conflict. The International Criminal Court is the world\u2019s permanent war crimes court. It was set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in countries where local authorities are unable or unwilling to conduct trials. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-story apartment building in Ukraine\u2019s capital on Friday, starting a fire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Russian military\u2019s claim it is not targeting civilian areas is \u201ca lie.\u201d He said that military and civilian areas in Ukraine are both being hit by Russian attacks. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north. ___ PARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that France and its European allies have decided to \u201cinflict very severe blows on Moscow,\u201d further sanctioning individuals and targeting finance, energy and other sectors. The legal texts for the sanctions will be finalized and submitted for approval to EU foreign ministers later Friday. Macron also said the EU has decided on economic aid for Ukraine in the amount of 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion). The French president also called the Belorussian government \u201can accomplice\u201d in Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine, and said it will also be targeted. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 As Russian troops continued pressing their offensive Friday, intense fighting also raged in the country\u2019s east. Russian troops entered the city of Sumy near the border with Russia that sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. The regional governor, Dmytro Zhivitsky, said Ukrainian forces fought Russian troops in the city overnight, but other Russian convoys kept rolling west toward the Ukrainian capital. \u201cMilitary vehicles from Sumy are moving toward Kyiv,\u201d Zhivitsky said. \u201cMuch equipment has passed through and is heading directly to the west.\u201d Zhivitsky added that another northeastern city, Konotop, was also sieged. He urged residents of the region to fight the Russian forces. ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says he is \u201cclosely following recent developments in and around Ukraine with increasing concern.\u201d Karim Khan issued a statement Friday on Twitter while on a visit to Bangladesh, where he is investigating crimes against Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya minority. Khan said he alerted \u201call sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine\u201d that Ukraine has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. That means \u201cmy office may exercise its jurisdiction over and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within the territory of Ukraine since 20 February 2014 onwards,\u201d Khan added. He said that \u201cany person who commits such crimes, including by ordering, inciting or contributing in another manner to the commission of these crimes may be liable to prosecution before the Court.\u201d Khan added that because neither Russia nor Ukraine are member states of the court, his office does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in the conflict. The International Criminal Court is the world\u2019s permanent war crimes court. It was set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in countries where local authorities are unable or unwilling to conduct trials. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine The Associated Press <!\u2013 Photo: 20220224150220-6217e922a7430ba4869de63ejpeg.jpg, Caption: A woman",

        "content": "The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis: MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says prospects for possible peace talks between Russia and Ukraine look uncertain due to apparent differences over a venue. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to send a delegation for talks with Ukrainian officials in Minsk, Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko runs a pro-Russian government. That agreement came in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s offer earlier in the day to discuss non-aligned status for Ukraine. Peskov told reporters that after the parties discussed Minsk as a possible venue, Ukrainian officials changed course and said they were unwilling to travel to Minsk and would prefer to meet in NATO member Poland. They then halted further communication, Peskov said. Putin has claimed that the western refusal to heed Russia\u2019s demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order an invasion of the neighboring country. ___ PRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s transport minister says his country has banned all Russian airlines from Czech airports, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Martin Kupka said Friday the ban covers all regular flights between Prague and Moscow and Prague and St. Petersburg, as well as charter flights. Russian planes will also be banned from landing at the western Czech spa town of Karlovy Vary, a popular destination for Russian tourists. The measure becomes affective at midnight. Additionally, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his country will stop issuing visas for Russian citizens and will urge other European Union countries to do the same. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Major retail chains in Lithuania started to remove Russian and Belarusian products from shelves, a move joined by online shops and widely applauded by the public as a protest against Moscow\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine. Maxima LT, the largest chain in the Baltic nations, said Friday the Russian goods it sells are mainly alcohol, dried products and candy, amounting to millions of euros (dollars) in sales. Other retailers like drug stores and home suppliers made similar announcements. The Lithuanian postal service said it will not be distributing any more Russian periodicals. International companies such as IKEA are facing pressure to remove Russian-made goods from sale in the small Baltic country, which fears Russian aggression. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed his troops for their courage as they press their offensive across Ukraine and bear down on Kyiv. Speaking during Friday\u2019s meeting of his Security Council, Putin claimed that most Ukrainian military units are reluctant to engage Russian forces. He said the units offering resistance are mostly volunteer battalions made up of right-wing Ukrainian nationalists. He offered no evidence for his claims, which could not be independently verified. Echoing an earlier Russian military statement, Putin accused Ukrainian forces of deploying heavy weapons in urban areas in several big cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, to use civilians as shields. The Russian president urged the Ukrainian military to end their resistance and turn on their leaders. ___ WARSAW, Poland \u2013 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is in Warsaw for urgent talks with NATO\u2019s nine eastern flank members on how to enhance the region\u2019s security, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The participants were also due to remotely join a NATO summit in Brussels. Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda, hosting the talks between the so-called NATO Bucharest Nine, in his opening speech said that \u201cdemons of a great war, unseen since 1945\u201d have returned to Europe. NATO\u2019s eastern flank members fear Moscow could also target them. ___ FORT STEWART, Ga. \u2014 The U.S. Army says 3,800 soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia, are among additional forces deploying to Europe following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Troops from the Army post southwest of Savannah, Georgia, \u201cwill deploy to reassure NATO allies, deter further aggression against NATO member states and train with host-nation forces,\u201d Fort Stewart commanders said in a statement late Thursday. Fort Stewart is home to the Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division, which saw multiple combat deployments during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most of the 3rd Infantry soldiers heading to Europe are assigned to the division\u2019s 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team. \u201cThe Raider Brigade is trained and equipped to deter aggression and to reassure and defend our allies,\u201d Col. Pete Moon, the 1st Brigade\u2019s commander, said in prepared statement. The Georgia-based soldiers appear to be among 7,000 additional U.S. forces deploying to Germany to bolster NATO following the invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden ordered the deployments Thursday. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Chinese President Xi Jinping he\u2019s ready to send a delegation for talks with Ukrainian officials. The Kremlin said in its readout of Friday\u2019s call that Xi underlined that he \u201cviews the Russian leadership\u2019s action in the crisis situation with respect.\u201d In a reference to new Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, the Kremlin noted that Putin and Xi agreed \u201cit\u2019s inadmissible to use illegitimate sanctions for achieving selfish goals of certain countries.\u201d Chinese state TV reported that Xi emphasized that China \u201csupports Russia and Ukraine resolving the problem through negotiations.\u201d ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 Dozens of parents, relatives and friends of Indian students stranded in Ukraine held a demonstration near the Russian Embassy in New Delhi to demand the students\u2019 immediate evacuation. Police barricaded the roads leading to the embassy on Friday and asked the protesters to meet Indian Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the repatriation of nearly 16,000 Indians, including students. Some of the demonstrators held video conferencing calls with some of those stuck in metro trains and bomb shelters in Kyiv. \u201cWe are running low on food and water in a crowded bunker,\u201d one of the callers in Ukraine said. Indian Embassy officials are now traveling to border areas of Ukraine touching Poland, Romania Slovakia and Hungary to facilitate the exit of Indian nationals so that they can be evacuated to India, said foreign ministy official Harsh Vardhan Shringla. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 Germany\u2019s foreign minister said Friday that the European Union will take in all people fleeing Ukraine due to the current conflict. \u201cWe need to do everything to immediately take in the people who are now fleeing bombs, fleeing tanks, that\u2019s also what we\u2019ve been preparing for in recent weeks,\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Brussels. \u201cWe tried everything so this day wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it came because the Russian president chose it, opted for war and against human lives.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we will take in all of the people who are fleeing now,\u201d Baerbock said. \u201cWe will bring the people from Ukraine to safety.\u201d ___ BUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Moldova\u2019s national naval agency says a ship in \u201cneutral waters\u201d of the Black Sea has been hit by a missile, leaving two crew members seriously injured. The Naval Agency said in a statement that the source of the missile that hit the Moldova-flagged Millennial Spirit on Friday is unknown. \u201cA fire broke out onboard the ship; the equipment and lifeboats were destroyed,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThe ship\u2019s crew left the ship equipped only with life jackets.\u201d The agency said that the company that operates the tanker is a Ukrainian legal entity and the crew members are Russian citizens. Rescue operations were carried out by Ukrainian authorities, the Moldovan agency said. ___ LONDON \u2014 An expert in international trade says he thinks world leaders are reluctant to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system of financial transactions because it is the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of sanctions. Disconnecting Russia from SWIFT to try to force President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine would have major economic costs for western countries, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. Lee-Makiyama told the BBC that if Russia were cut off for foreign payments for its gas and oi,l it would quickly start expropriating the 300 billion euros EU investors have plowed into the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuclear option that it\u2019s going to basically exterminate yourself and your enemy,\u201d he said. World leaders, who have so far ruled out military intervention in Ukraine, have few good options for deterring Putin because he knows they fear a direct confrontation with Russia, Lee-Makiyama said. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says Russia is ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send the delegation in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s offer to discuss a non-aligned status for Ukraine. That indicates Zelenskyy would be willing to negotiate dropping his country\u2019s bid to join NATO, as Russia has demanded. Before the invasion, the West had rejected the demand. Putin claimed the refusal to discuss keeping Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order a military action in Ukraine to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it. ___ BANGKOK \u2014 Myanmar\u2019s ruling military council offered its support Friday for Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, while the shadow government leading opposition to army rule condemned Moscow\u2019s action. A statement by the spokesman for Myanmar\u2019s military government said Russia acted correctly to perpetuate its \u201csovereignty.\u201d A text message to Myanmar journalists from Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun also said the invasion demonstrated Russia\u2019s position as a \u201cworld power\u201d helping to keep global relations in balance. Myanmar\u2019s military rulers face armed domestic opposition, and like Russia\u2019s leaders now, are the target of strong sanctions from Western governments seeking a return to democratic rule. Myanmar\u2019s National Unity Government, established by lawmakers prevented from taking their seats when the army seized power in February last year, deplored Moscow\u2019s action. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Lithuania\u2019s Radio and Television Commission has temporarily suspended the operation of six Russian-language TV channels for their alleged incitement to war and propaganda. The six TV channels were taken off the air Friday Planeta RTR, Rossijya 24, Belarus 24, NTV Mir, RTR Planeta and Rossiya 24 were suspended for five years, and PBK and TVCI for three years, commission Vice Chairman Ricardas Slapsys told the Baltic News Service. Lithuania, the most southern of the three Baltic nations, borders Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region to the southwest, Belarus to the east, Latvia to the north and Poland to the south. Latvia banned several Russian television channels had their right to broadcast in Latvia suspended Thursday for several years. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military claims it has taken control of an airport just outside Kyiv, as Kremlin forces bear down on the Ukrainian capital. The claim could not be independently verified. Taking possession of the airport in Hostomel, which has a long runway allowing the landing of heavy-lift transport planes, would mean Russia can airlift troops directly to Kyiv\u2019s outskirts. Hostomel is just 7 kilometers (4 miles) northwest of the city. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that the Russian airborne forces used 200 helicopters to land in Hostomel and killed over 200 troops belonging to Ukraine\u2019s special forces. Konashenkov claimed that Russian troops suffered no casualties. That contradicts Ukrainian claims that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s Defense Ministry has confirmed media reports that it is deploying additional military assets to NATO\u2019s eastern flank. German weekly Der Spiegel reported that the deployments included 150 soldiers and about a dozen Boxer armored fighting vehicles, two ships and anti-missile systems. Ministry spokesman Christian Thiels declined to say Friday exactly how many soldiers were being deployed. But he confirmed that a navy corvette would leave Saturday for patrols in the Baltic while a frigate will be deployed in the Mediterranean, both under NATO command. Germany is also assessing whether to deploy Patriot anti-missile systems to an eastern European NATO country, Thiels said. Decisions on deploying further troops could be expected soon, he added. ___ BEIJING \u2014 Chinese state TV says Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that Moscow is willing to negotiate with Ukraine, even as Moscow\u2019s forces invade its neighbor. The report Friday followed a Kremlin announcement that Putin\u2019s government was considering an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate non-aligned status for his country. Putin said Moscow \u201cis willing to conduct high-level negotiations with the Ukrainian side,\u201d China Central Television reported on its website. It gave no indication whether Putin said he was responding to Zelenskyy\u2019s offer or gave any details of what the two sides might negotiate. Russia complains that the United States and its allies ignored Moscow\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns\u201d by expanding the NATO military alliance eastward, closer to Russia\u2019s borders. Xi said China \u201csupports Russia and Ukraine resolving the problem through negotiations,\u201d CCTV said. ___ ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey\u2019s foreign minister says officials are still assessing a request by Ukraine for Turkey to close to Russian shipping the straits at the entrance of the Black Sea. Mevlut Cavusoglu warned, however, that under a 1936 convention Ankara may not be able to deny total access to the Russian vessels. Ukraine on Thursday formally asked Turkey to close the Turkish Straits to Russian warships in line with the Montreux Convention which allows Turkey to restrict the passage of belligerent countries\u2019 warships during times of war. The convention stipulates however, that warships belonging to Black Sea coastal countries can return to their bases. \u201cIf there is a demand for the ships of the warring countries to return to their bases, then (passage) must be allowed,\u201d Cavusoglu was quoted as telling Hurriyet newspaper in an interview. The minister said Turkish experts were assessing if the current situation amounted to \u201ca state of war.\u201d ___ BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s president is appealing to Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201cstop the madness of this war now.\u201d President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in Berlin on Friday said that \u201cwe don\u2019t want enmity with the Russian people, quite the contrary, but this wrongdoing cannot go without a clear answer.\u201d Steinmeier, whose post is largely ceremonial but holds moral authority, said that Germany will do its part in deterring Putin from using force against its NATO allies. The president, who served twice as Germany\u2019s foreign minister, said that Putin \u201cshould not underestimate the strength of democracies\u201d and Germans shouldn\u2019t either. He said it\u2019s good that people are going out to demonstrate, adding: \u201cThe Russian president should not believe for a second that people in Germany and Europe simply accept this brutal violence.\u201d ___ VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis went to the Russian embassy in Rome on Friday to personally express his concern about the war in Ukraine, in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent. Popes usually receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican. For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of feeling about Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted \u201cclearly to express his concern about the war.\u201d Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said. Francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. But he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties. ___ GENEVA \u2014 The U.N. human rights office says it is receiving increasing reports of civilian casualties in Ukraine in the wake of Russia\u2019s military invasion. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says its staffers have so far verified at least 127 civilian casualties. They include 25 people killed and 102 injured, mostly from shelling and airstrikes. She cautioned Friday that the numbers are \u201cvery likely to be an underestimate.\u201d Shamdasani also said the rights office was \u201cdisturbed by the multiple arbitrary arrests\u201d of demonstrators in Russia who on Thursday protested against the conflict. \u201cWe understand more than 1,800 protesters were arrested,\u201d she said, before adding that it was unclear how many might have been released already. Meanwhile, spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo of the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said its latest update had that more than 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes in Ukraine. She said the agency\u2019s planning figures anticipated that \u201cup to 4 million people may flee to other countries if the situation escalates.\u201d ___ LONDON \u2014 Latvia\u2019s defense minister is criticizing European nations for failing to cut Russia off from the global bank payments network and refusing to provide weapons to help Ukraine defend itself. Artis Pabriks\u2019 comments came after the U.S. and European Union stopped short of blocking Russia\u2019s access to the SWIFT payments system when they announced a new round of sanctions late Thursday. Pabriks also chided fellow EU nations that have refused to provide \u201clethal aid\u201d to Ukraine, saying only the U.K., Greece, Poland and the Baltic states had done so. In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Pabriks suggested that many European leaders don\u2019t want to take these steps because they would cause economic hardship for their own countries. \u201cIf you are really not ready yourself to spill blood, at least spill money now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cDo it now, because if you lose Ukraine all European geopolitics will change. \u2026 There will be much more pressure on Poland, much more pressure on the Baltics.\u2019\u2019 The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia fear they could be the Kremlin\u2019s next target. ___ DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Syrian President Bashar Assad is praising Russia\u2019s military incursion into Ukraine and denouncing what he calls western \u201chysteria\u201d surrounding it. Assad spoke by phone Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWhat is happening today is a correction of history and a restoration of balance which was lost in the world after the breakup of the Soviet Union,\u201d Assad said, according to state-run news agency SANA. He said confronting NATO expansionism is Russia\u2019s right. Russia is a main backer of Assad\u2019s government and its military intervention in 2015 in the country\u2019s civil war helped tip the balance of power in his favor. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin says it will analyze the Ukrainian president\u2019s offer to discuss a non-aligned status for his country, as a Russian military invasion pushes closer to Kyiv. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was ready to hold talks on the issue. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s offer, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday described it as \u201ca move in a positive direction.\u201d He said in a conference call with reporters that \u201cwe paid attention to that, and now we need to analyze it.\u201d But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Zelenskyy \u201cis simply lying\u201d when he offers to discuss non-aligned status for Ukraine. Lavrov said at a briefing that Zelenskyy \u201cmissed the opportunity\u201d to discuss a neutral status for Ukraine when Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed it. Putin says the West left him no option but to invade when it rejected Moscow\u2019s demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 A senior European Union official says the 27-nation bloc intends to slap further sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. EU Council president Charles Michel tweeted Friday: \u201cSecond wave of sanctions with massive and severe consequences politically agreed last night. Further package under urgent preparation.\u201d Michel announced the move after a call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Michel said Kyiv \u201cis under continued attack by Russian forces\u201d and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence. ___ BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary has extended temporary legal protection to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, as countries in eastern Europe prepare for the arrival of refugees at their borders. Hungary, which borders Ukraine to the west, has in the past taken a firm stance against all forms of immigration. It has controversially refused to accept refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But in a decree published late Thursday, Hungary\u2019s government announced that all Ukrainian citizens arriving from Ukraine, and all third-country nationals legally residing there, would be entitled to protection. The section applying to third-country nationals makes it possible for non-Ukrainians \u2014 for example, Belarussian refugees living in Ukraine \u2014 to receive protection in the European Union. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungary will play no part in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that it would accept refugees arriving at its borders. ___ LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his solidarity with Ukraine in telephone call with the country\u2019s leader. Johnson\u2019s Downing Street office said Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered an update on Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes. \u201cThe prime minister assured President Zelenskyy that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing,\u2019\u2019 Johnson\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cHe paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia\u2019s campaign of violence and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.\u2019\u2019 ___ BERLIN \u2014 The German government says it has suspended the granting of export credit and investment guarantees for business with Russia. The Economy Ministry said Friday that the granting of new export credit guarantees and investment guarantees for Russia was suspended on Thursday. The so-called Hermes credit export guarantees protect German companies from losses when exports aren\u2019t paid for. Investment guarantees are granted by the German government to protect direct investments by German companies from political risk in the countries where they are made. The Economy Ministry said that new export credit guarantees to the tune of 1.49 billion euros ($1.67 billion) were granted last year for business with Russia. New investment guarantees came in at a fraction of that amount, at 3.75 million euros ($4.2 million). ___ WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland\u2019s Border Guard says that some 29,000 people were cleared to enter through the country\u2019s land border with neighboring Ukraine on Thursday, the day Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began. Before that, there were some 12,000 average daily entries from Ukraine into European Union and NATO member Poland, through land, sea and airport checkpoints, according to Border Guard statistics. Poland has lifted the requirement of COVID-19 quarantine or vaccination certificates for refugees from Ukraine. A number of reception centers with camp beds, soup kitchens and medical care have been organized in locations close to the border with Ukraine. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China is holding back from labeling Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine an invasion. At the same time, it is upholding the sanctity of territorial sovereignty, in a nod to its own insistence that Taiwan is part of China. \u201cThe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and maintained,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday. \u201cAt the same time, we also see that the issue of Ukraine has its own complex and special historical merits, and we understand Russia\u2019s legitimate concerns on security issues,\u201d he added. Wang did not answer questions about whether China would recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, in Ukrainian territory claimed by Russia, as independent states. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s civil aviation authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation against the British government\u2019s ban on Aeroflot flights. Rosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday. It said the measure was taken in response to the \u201cunfriendly decisions\u201d by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military claims it has destroyed 118 Ukrainian military assets since the beginning of its assault on its neighbor and as it pushes into the outskirts of Kyiv. The claim could not be independently verified and was not confirmed by Ukraine amid a flurry of claims and counterclaims by each side. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that among the targets were 11 Ukrainian air bases, 13 command facilities, 36 air defense radars, 14 air defense missile systems, 5 warplanes, 18 tanks and warships. However, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace rejected Russian claims of success on the first day of its invasion of Ukraine, saying it had \u201cfailed to deliver\u201d on its day one objectives. Wallace told Sky News that the Western assessment is that Russia had failed to take its major objectives and is behind on its timetable for advance. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost over 450 personnel,\u2019\u2019 he said. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, calling it \u201ca deep cut in European history after the end of the Cold War.\u201d Germany\u2019s dpa news agency quoted Merkel saying Friday that there was \u201cno justification for this blatant attack of international law. I condemn it in the sharpest possible manner.\u201d Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and speaks Russian, was heavily engaged in negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout her 16 years in office, which ended in December. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy regulatory agency says that higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but didn\u2019t provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a \u201cdisturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air.\u201d Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle Thursday. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian airborne troops were protecting the plant to prevent any possible \u201cprovocations.\u201d He insisted that radiation levels in the area have remained normal. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been \u201cno casualties or destruction at the industrial site.\u201d The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks. ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says he is \u201cclosely following recent developments in and around Ukraine with increasing concern.\u201d Karim Khan warned \u201call sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine\u201d that Ukraine has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. That means \u201cmy office may exercise its jurisdiction over and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within the territory of Ukraine since 20 February 2014 onwards, Khan said in a statement Friday. Khan adds that because neither Russia nor Ukraine are member states of the court, his office does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in the conflict. The International Criminal Court is the world\u2019s permanent war crimes court. It was set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in countries where local authorities are unable or unwilling to conduct trials. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-story apartment building in Ukraine\u2019s capital on Friday, starting a fire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Russian military\u2019s claim it is not targeting civilian areas is \u201ca lie.\u201d He said that military and civilian areas in Ukraine are both being hit by Russian attacks. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north. ___ PARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that France and its European allies have decided to \u201cinflict very severe blows on Moscow,\u201d further sanctioning individuals and targeting finance, energy and other sectors. The legal texts for the sanctions will be finalized and submitted for approval to EU foreign ministers later Friday. Macron also said the EU has decided on economic aid for Ukraine in the amount of 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion). The French president also called the Belorussian government \u201can accomplice\u201d in Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine, and said it will also be targeted. ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 As Russian troops continued pressing their offensive Friday, intense fighting also raged in the country\u2019s east. Russian troops entered the city of Sumy near the border with Russia that sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. The regional governor, Dmytro Zhivitsky, said Ukrainian forces fought Russian troops in the city overnight, but other Russian convoys kept rolling west toward the Ukrainian capital. \u201cMilitary vehicles from Sumy are moving toward Kyiv,\u201d Zhivitsky said. \u201cMuch equipment has passed through and is heading directly to the west.\u201d Zhivitsky added that another northeastern city, Konotop, was also sieged. He urged residents of the region to fight the Russian forces. ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says he is \u201cclosely following recent developments in and around Ukraine with increasing concern.\u201d Karim Khan issued a statement Friday on Twitter while on a visit to Bangladesh, where he is investigating crimes against Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya minority. Khan said he alerted \u201call sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine\u201d that Ukraine has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. That means \u201cmy office may exercise its jurisdiction over and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within the territory of Ukraine since 20 February 2014 onwards,\u201d Khan added. He said that \u201cany person who commits such crimes, including by ordering, inciting or contributing in another manner to the commission of these crimes may be liable to prosecution before the Court.\u201d Khan added that because neither Russia nor Ukraine are member states of the court, his office does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in the conflict. The International Criminal Court is the world\u2019s permanent war crimes court. It was set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in countries where local authorities are unable or unwilling to conduct trials. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine The Associated Press <!\u2013 Photo: 20220224150220-6217e922a7430ba4869de63ejpeg.jpg, Caption: A woman",

        "content": "A damaged residential building is seen in Kyiv, following Russian attacks (Credits: Reuters) As Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine intensifies, technology companies are mobilising to help employees based in the country. Many American, Israeli and British companies have offices in Ukraine and rely on the emerging tech talent there to bolster their workforces. But as Vladimir Putin continues his advance towards Kyiv, they are shifting focus to help workers and their families. In a post on LinkedIn, the CEO of Grammerly, Brad Hoover, said his company remains \u2018committed to Ukraine\u2019. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live The learning and artificial intelligence company was founded in the country and has its main office in Kyiv. \u2018While we hope for the best, we have also prepared for the worst,\u2019 Hoover wrote. \u2018That includes having contingency plans for various scenarios, along with financial and logistical assistance to better support our team members and their families in getting to safety.\u2019 Hey, world, this war is not about Ukraine.

Vlad Yatsenko, co-founder and chief technology officer of Revult, slammed Putin on Twitter as a \u2018brazen liar\u2019. Yatsenko is from Mykolaiv, a key flashpoint in the invasion. \u2018I hope most Russians will finally be able to see that their president is one of the most brazen liars in history\u2026 Using the overtones of \u201cdefending\u201d the Russians, Putin attacked a peaceful Ukraine.

There were moms with strollers, there were grandmothers hobbling along the street. It was a human exodus involving thousands of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just terrifying to watch this humanitarian crisis play out in real time, this huge exodus that has been unprecedented in history,\u201d Marotta said.

He saw heartbreaking moments as terrified families were separated. \u201cI saw several times fathers being pulled from their families often very tearfully and the Ukrainian army soldiers present seem to be unrepentant about it.

But, he says, suddenly a man with a loudspeaker made an announcement that all 18- to 60-year-old men would not be allowed to leave. \u201cThis commissar pulled him aside and said, \u2018come with us.\u2019 He looked at us one last time and he just smiled this weird, not weird, but it was sort of like a disbelief smile, and he was pulled away.

I\u2019m all for peace.\u201dMedvedev admitted that he was distracted by the news all day on Thursday, and he honestly found it difficult to focus on his match that night. With the conflict continuing on, it continues to be a distraction for Medvedev as he prepares for his semi-final match against Rafael Nadal on Friday night.\u201cIn this moment, you understand that tennis sometimes is not that important,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIt was definitely not easy to play and I am happy that I managed to win the match. That was a little bit of a roller-coaster day.\u201dMedvedev was asked about his fellow Russian player, world No. 7 Andrey Rublev, and his recent doubles win with Ukrainian Denys Molchanov last week. Medvedev saw this victory as symbolic in ways.\u201cThis was amazing because I think people need to stay together and that\u2019s the most important,\u201d Medvedev said.More Tennis Coverage:Will Roger Federer Pass His Rivals Again?Novak Djokovic Is Still Making Bad DecisionsSaying Farewell to Juan Martin del Potro",

Reporting live on BBC World News this morning, journalist Olga Malchevska reacted to footage of her family home being shown, as BBC producers realised they were showing the actual building she had lived in. Olga emotionally shared that she had just received a message from her mum, who she had not yet had contact with and was safe \u2018hiding in the basement\u2019 in Kyiv.

Starting from around 3am UK time yesterday, attacks were reported across Ukraine, including in several western cities close to the border with Poland. That triggered the price of Brent crude oil to jump by 8% by 11.40am to $104.56 barrel, hitting its highest point since 2014 before falling back slightly. Ukraine is also a major food supplier, something experts say could push up inflation and put further pressure on household finances. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: \u2018Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher.\u00a0 \u2018Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices.\u2019 A damaged residential building is seen in Ukraine (Reuters) Europe relies on Russia for large amounts of oil, gas and wheat, and experts have warned conflict could lead to soaring energy prices and disruption to shipping routes. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the price of petrol would be \u2018significantly higher\u2019 than\u00a0 \u00a31.70 a litre if the Russian invasion continued. UK household budgets are already being put under increasing pressure amid inflation and tax hikes. The RAC has said that the average price of a litre of petrol and diesel at UK forecourts on Sunday was 149p and 153p respectively. Ukrainian citizens arrive by train to Poland from Ukraine (Getty) While the Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced last week the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation reached 5.5% in January \u2013 up from 5.4% in December. The announcement means the CPI is at the highest point since March 1992, when it stood at 7.1%. British gas prices fell this morning after sharp gains the previous day. The weekend gas price was down 15p at 261p per therm in the UK gas market, while the summer 2020 contract slumped by 70p to 260p/therm.

Twitter users certainly think so...On Friday (February 25), the Chicago rapper's name started trending on Twitter and it's not because of his music.

Some cleverly edited photos actually show him in battle as fans are convinced that the Glo Gang general can save us from doom and terror.The memes went viral enough for the 26-year-old rapper to catch onto the trend, joking that he's packing his bags and flying off to Ukraine.\"On the way to Ukraine,\" wrote Keef on Instagram alongside a gun emoji.Do you think that Chief Keef has what it takes to save the world from disaster?

The advisory notice informed that the Indian government and its embassy in Ukraine are currently working to establish routes from southeastern European country Romania to central European country Hungary to relocate the Indian nationals.

        "content": "Former heavyweight champion Vitali is the mayor of Kiev The mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, has joined his fellow former boxing champion brother Wladimir\u00a0in speaking about the Russian military operation in Ukraine, while current title holder Oleksandr Usyk has admitted he is \"really emotional\" and called for unity. Ex-heavyweight king Klitschko became mayor of the city in 2014 and has regularly issued messages on social media amid political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Standing alongside his younger sibling, the 50-year-old pledged to \"fight for freedom and democracy\", praised Ukrainian military forces and pledged to protect the city. Usyk said that some fans had accused him of \"running away\" by visiting London, where he beat Anthony Joshua to sensationally claim the heavyweight title in September, for a meeting earlier this week. Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky has banned men\u00a0between 18 and 60 from leaving his country since the Russian military initiative began. \"I was at work but I'm back, I'm home,\" Usyk said in an Instagram video\u00a0translated by ESPN. \"Friends, we have to unite because it's a hard time right now and I'm really emotional and worried about my country and our people.\" Revered three-time champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Vasiliy Lomachenko has reportedly fled Ukraine for Greece. \"The situation in Ukraine escalated a lot in the last couple of days,\" he was quoted by the outlet as saying, adding that he was trying to focus on his next fight rather than the news. \"My family is there in the middle of everything. But I am going to have my people there and my family is safe.\" Usyk added a photo of himself in Ukraine and added the caption \"no war\". The 35-year-old is reportedly close to confirming a rematch with Joshua, although he denied claims by WBC champion Tyson Fury this week that he is ducking him, offering to fight the Mancunian in a bare-knuckle brawl.",

        "description": "Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia pressed its\u00a0invasion of Ukraine\u00a0to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was reported in several areas, as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine's president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government, cause massive casualties and ripple out damage to the global economy. Oklahoma Dept. of Transportation crews still treating slick, hazardous areas on highways, interstates Among the signs that the Ukrainian capital was increasingly threatened, the military said Friday that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district on the outskirts of Kyiv, and police told people not to exit a subway station in the city center because there was gunfire in the area. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armored vehicles rolled down the streets, while many residents stood uneasily in doorways of their apartment buildings. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv \u201ccould well be under siege\" in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to install his own regime. The assault, anticipated for weeks by the U.S. and Western allies, amounts to the largest ground war in Europe since World War II. After repeatedly denying plans to invade, the autocratic Putin launched his attack on the country, which has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow\u2019s sway. Oklahoma City Police arrest man for impersonating officer Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose grasp on power was increasingly tenuous, appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions\u00a0than the ones imposed by Western allies\u00a0and for defense assistance. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door,\u201d said the leader, who cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, declared martial law and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days. Zelenskyy said he\u2019s the No. 1 target for the invading Russians but that he planned to remain in Kyiv. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said early Friday that the Ukrainian attended a meeting of European Union leaders via video link from what appeared to be some sort of bunker. As air raids sirens sounded in the capital early Friday, guests of a hotel in the city center were directed to a makeshift basement shelter, lined with piles of mattresses and bottles of water. Workers, all local university students, served tea and cookies to the guests. Some people ducked out to a courtyard to smoke or get fresh air. \u201cWe\u2019re all scared and worried. We don\u2019t know what to do then, what\u2019s going to happen in a few days,\u201d said one of the workers, Lucy Vashaka, 20. Oklahoma City homeowner allegedly shot by former roommate The\u00a0invasion began\u00a0early Thursday with a series of missile strikes on cities and military bases, and then quickly followed with a multi-pronged ground assault that rolled troops in from several areas in the east; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north. After Ukrainian officials said they lost control of\u00a0the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, Russia said Friday it was working with the Ukrainians to secure the plant. There was no corroboration of such cooperation from the Ukrainian side. Zelenskyy said that 137 \u201cheroes,\u201d including 10 military officers, had been killed, and one of his advisers said about 400 Russian forces had died. Moscow has given no casualty count. Neither claim could be independently verified. Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv's subway stations. At times it felt almost cheerful. Families ate dinner. Children played. Adults chatted. People brought sleeping bags or dogs or crossword puzzles \u2014 anything to alleviate the waiting and the long night ahead. \u201cNobody believed that this war would start and that they would take Kyiv directly,\u201d said Anton Mironov, waiting out the night in one of the old Soviet metro stations. \u201cI feel mostly fatigue. None of it feels real.\u201d Oklahoma City man dies after vehicle crash on H.E. Bailey Turnpike Many who spent the night in makeshift bunkers, emerged in the early hours of Friday to a relatively quiet city. Some traffic and cars moved along highways, along with columns of military. The lines at fuel stations the day before had evaporated. With social media\u00a0amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground. Russia said it was not targeting cities, but journalists saw destruction in many civilian areas and Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a rocket hit a multistory apartment building in the city on Friday, starting a fire. Meanwhile, the mayor of the city in the rebel-controlled east said Ukrainian shelling hit a school building. The Ukrainian military on Friday reported significant fighting near Ivankiv, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv, as Russian forces apparently tried to advance on the capital from the north. Russian troops also entered the city of Sumy, near the border with Russia that sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. Later came the reports of at least some forces much closer. \u201cThe hardest day will be today. The enemy\u2019s plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv,\u201d Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. UPDATE: Oklahoma City boy freed from beneath truck, transported to hospital Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-decommissioned Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone, presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been\u00a0\u201cno casualties or destruction at the industrial site.\u201d The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket. Condemnation came not only from the U.S. and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond \u2014 and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin. U.S. President Joe Biden\u00a0announced new sanctions\u00a0that will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, saying Putin \u201cchose this war\u201d and had exhibited a \u201csinister\u201d view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. He added that the measures were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe. Biden was to meet Friday morning with fellow leaders of NATO governments in what the White House described as an \u201cextraordinary virtual summit\u201d to discuss Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he aimed to cut off Russia from the U.K.\u2019s financial markets as he announced sanctions, freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets. Reports: Senator Jim Inhofe to step down \u201cNow we see him for what he is \u2014 a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,\u201d Johnson said of Putin. Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and West to go further and\u00a0cut the Russians from the SWIFT system, a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world. The White House has been reluctant to do that, worried it could cause enormous economic problems in Europe and elsewhere in the West. While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the U.S. and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the U.S. was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO. Ukrainians were urged to shelter in place and not to panic. \u201cUntil the very last moment, I didn\u2019t believe it would happen. I just pushed away these thoughts,\u201d said a terrified Anna Dovnya in Kyiv, watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell. \u201cWe have lost all faith.\u201d",

        "content": "The Russian Grand Prix was due to take place in September in Sochi (Picture: Getty) Formula One bosses have cancelled the Russian Grand Prix. The race in Sochi was due to take place on September 25, but it has now been scrapped following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. F1\u2019s announcement arrived two hours after UEFA confirmed this season\u2019s Champions League final will be moved from St Petersburg to Paris. Turkey has been mooted as a potential alternative venue for the now cancelled Russian Grand Prix (Picture: Getty) A statement read: \u2018The FIA Formula One World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together. We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation. \u2018On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.\u2019 F1 acted after CEO Stefano Domenicali chaired a crisis summit with its governing body, the FIA, and the sport\u2019s team bosses on Thursday night. Haas have removed the Uralkali branding from their car (Picture: Getty) It is unclear at this stage if the race will be replaced, but Turkey\u2019s Istanbul Park has been mooted as a contender to fill the now vacant slot on the calendar. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel earlier said he would boycott the Russian race and described Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime as \u2018mad\u2019. \u2018I am sorry for the innocent people that are losing their lives, that are getting killed for stupid reason,\u2019 he added. \u2018It is a very strange and mad leadership. \u2018I am shocked and sad to see what is going on.

        "content": "Did The Simpsons do it again? (Picture: Fox) The Simpsons boss Al Jean has reacted to yet another \u2018prediction\u2019 from the long-running animation, as fans suggested it pre-empted the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sadly, to Jean, this \u2018prediction\u2019 was not a coincidence. This week Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, with rocket strikes destroying swathes of the country. As of Thursday night, 137 people were killed and a further 316 have have been wounded. However, these numbers are expected to be significantly higher as bombing continued throughout the night and Russian troops have begun to storm the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. For the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war, visit our live blog: Russia-Ukraine live And because the US series has seemingly \u2018predicted\u2019 some of the world\u2019s biggest political and cultural moments, from Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to Lady Gaga\u2019s SuperBowl performance, The Simpsons fans have suggested the show prophesied Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In 1998 episode, Simpson Tide, we see a United Nations meeting between Russia and the United States where it\u2019s revealed the Soviet Union never truly dissolved, as soldiers come out of hiding to patrol, hidden tanks blast forth from parade floats and a barbed-wired Berlin Wall with machine-gun-wielding troops emerges. Even Vladimir Lenin returns from his mummified state to \u2018crush Capitalism\u2019. The Simpsons predicted theCrisis of #Putin, #Russia,#Ukraine and #Donetsk and#Luhansk way before it was cool \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00af\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2020#RussiaUkraineCrisis#Ukraina #ukrainerussia #USA pic.twitter.com/Hqd2icRj6w\u2014 Genius Manushya (@GeniusManushya) February 22, 2022 The sign displayed \u2018Russia\u2019 before rotating (Picture: Fox) Soldiers came out of hiding (Picture: Fox) So, of course people have been prompted to remark \u2018The Simpsons has done it again\u2019, despite, we should note, the invasion of Ukraine not marking the return of the Soviet Union. One noted on Twitter: \u2018The simpsons are basically a visual version of the library of babel,\u2019 as another mused: \u2018Return of The Soviet Union?!? Yeah Simpsons predicted that, too.\u2019 Lenin vowed to \u2018crush capitalism\u2019 (Picture: Fox) Sharing their hot take, another wrote: \u2018Throughout the post-Cold War era, the Simpsons have understood Russia better than most Western decision/policy makers. The Iron Curtain never really fell, it was just taken down for a brief period for repairs, with the aim to be hung up again as far west as possible.\u2019 Reacting to an article touting the \u2018prediction\u2019, long-time Simpsons showrunner Jean wrote on Twitter: \u2018Very sad to say this was not hard to predict.\u2019 Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Jean added that this was more \u2018the norm\u2019 than a \u2018prediction\u2019. \u2018In terms of predictions, there are two kinds we have: The trivial, like Don Mattingly getting in trouble for his hair in \u2018Homer at the Bat,\u2019 he said. \u2018And then there are predictions like this. I hate to say it, but I was born in 1961, so 30 years of my life were lived with the specter of the Soviet Union. So, to me, this is sadly more the norm than it is a prediction. We just figured things were going to go bad.\u2019 Jean went on: \u2018Historical aggression never really goes away, and you have to be super vigilant. In 1998, when this clip aired, it was maybe the zenith of U.S.-Russia relations. But ever since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin got in, almost everybody has made it clear that he\u2019s a bad guy and bad things are going to happen.\u2019 MORE : Did The Simpsons \u2018predict\u2019 Super Bowl LVI winner?

While the rest of the world has been watching events unfold in shock and fear, Trump was on stage lauding Putin\u2019s strategy, just hours before the Russian president ordered troops to invade its neighboring country. At a fundraiser on Wednesday, Trump had said: \u2018I mean, he\u2019s taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions, I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty smart. \u2018He\u2019s taking over a country, really a vast, vast, location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.\u2019 Meyers was completely shocked and disgusted, saying on his Late Night chat show: \u2018First of all, stop talking about everything like it\u2019s a f***ing real estate deal. \u2018It\u2019s an illegal war against a sovereign nation, not an empty lot in Atlantic City,\u2019 he said. The TV host added: \u2018Second, if you ever find yourself at a fancy high-dollar fundraiser clinking champagne glasses while the keynote speaker applauds an illegal and catastrophic war that will cause mass suffering and destabilize an entire continent, maybe take a moment to text your therapist and ask, \u201cAm I a bad person?\u201d\u2018 A day before, Trump had hit out at President Biden saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would not have happened on his watch, whilst at the same time describing Putin\u2019s initial moves of invasion as \u2018genius\u2019 and \u2018savvy\u2019. Meyers was not the only late-night talk show host to try and make light out of a very dark, sombre day. Stephen Colbert said: \u2018Over the last five years, we\u2019ve seen democracy reportedly undermined, tragic, unprecedented firestorms, a global pandemic. \u2018Well this morning, Vladimir Putin looked at all of that and said, \u201cHold my vodka.\u201d\u2018 He added, referring to Trump-supporting Putin: \u2018Amidst all this horror, it\u2019s important to keep our eyes on the unhinged fascist lunatic.\u2019 More: US TV newsBeyonce cameo in Kanye West\u2019s Jeen-Yuhs as she secretly dated Jay Z sends fans wildJohn Cena slammed for 'using Ukraine invasion' to promote Peacemaker in 'tone deaf' tweetWWE star Cesaro leaves company after 10 years in shock exit Putin declared war around 5am local time on Thursday, ordering troops into the neighboring country in a three-pronged invasion from the north, east and south, appearing to target the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson. Missiles were shot at several cities, and huge explosions are continuing to rattle Kyiv in the early hours of this morning as the second day of the incursion began with a missile barrage.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Amid the military operations in Ukraine by Russia, American actor, director and screenwriter Sean Penn has put himself in the centre of crisis as he has reached Ukraine to record events for documentaries about Russia's invasion.At this moment when Russia has started full-scale on its neighbour, the actor arrived in Ukraine only to record all that is happening in the country so that he can provide a clear picture in front of the world about Russia's invasion in Ukraine. On Thursday 24 February the long-time humanitarian activist and Oscar-winning actor Penn was spotted in Ukraine's capital city Kyiv during a press conference by the Ukrainian government. Penn was seen listening to the government officials of Ukraine speaking about the huge crises due to the Russian attacks. Many global leaders in the press briefing have been regarding the Russian-Ukraine conflict as the worst conflict in Europe since the year 1945. In November last year, the actor visited Ukraine to research and gather the required information for the documentary. According to reports, the 61-year-old actor Penn arrived in Ukraine capita Kyiv in the previous week and had a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. He also met the military members and local journalists in the city dealing with the current situation. In a recent statement issued by the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, it has praised the western actor who gave a special visit to Kyiv to understand the situation and record events to present the truth of the Russian invasion of the country. The statement reads Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in the present situation. The country is grateful to him for his honesty and courage in supporting Ukraine at this tough time. The President also stated that the actor through this step demonstrates bravery that many other are lacking mainly the Western politicians. He added that the more people like this, Ukraine's true friend comes forward, the quicker the country can deal with the Russian invasion putting a stop to it.

We are not getting any clear guidance on what to do. Initially, we were asked to move to the bunker. When we packed our bags and reached there, our university head asked us to go back to our hostel room. So we came back. Movement is very risky in these times,\" Ashra said, as quoted in a report by PTI. Two professional students, Swalika and Ameya, are waiting for instructions from authorities with regards to shifting to the nearest bunker. They were told that at any point in time, water and power supply might be halted. They were worried about contacting their families back in Kerala, not being able to withdraw money from ATMs, limited food storage and so on.",

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a powerful message in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Writing in a joint statement on their Archewell website, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wrote: \"We stand with the people of Ukraine.\"\"Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and all of us at Archewell stand with the people of Ukraine against this breach of international and humanitarian law and encourage the global community and its leaders to do the same,\" a spokesperson for the couple wrote.\u00a0It appears to be the first statement issued by members of the royal family about the Russian invasion.\u00a0Russian forces attacked Ukraine with airstrikes and shelling in the early hours of Thursday morning in an invasion that had been feared for weeks, something that President Vladimir Putin called a \"peace-keeping operation.\"As Insider previously reported, Putin recognized two Ukrainian separatist regions \u2014 Luhansk and Donetsk \u2014 as independent states, calling Ukraine \"not just a neighboring country,\" but also \"an inherent part of our history\" with \"blood and family ties\" during a speech on Monday, according to the RT translation.Harry and Markle's statement comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation on Thursday.\u00a0In the statement, Johnson said he offers the support of the UK and condemned Putin's actions.\"I say to the Ukrainians in this moment of agony, we are praying for you and your families and we are on your side,\" Johnson said in the video message.Read the original article on Insider",

        "content": "Russian forces are already far west in Ukraine, fuelling fears that they could push on across Europe (Picture: Reuters/ABC) Vladimir Putin may push further into Eastern Europe after he takes over Ukraine, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said. The grim warning comes as satellite images show Russians soldiers and artillery building up in the Belarusian city of Brest \u2013 just 10 miles east of the Polish border. Moscow is said to have assembled more than 50 heavy equipment transporters at a training area in near the city, according to Pentagon national security reporter Jack Detsch. It has also added more equipment at a nearby railyard, the correspondent for Foreign Policy magazine added. Exactly why Russia has amassed these troops is unclear, but Blinken fears Putin may have goals beyond Ukraine. He told CBS Evening News: \u2018You don\u2019t need intelligence to tell you that that\u2019s exactly what President Putin wants. \u2018He\u2019s made clear that he\u2019d like to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he\u2019d like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighbouring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. \u2018And short of that, he\u2019d like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\u2019 NEW: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to @DavidMuir: \u201cIs it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it\u2019s a possibility.\u201dMore tonight on @ABCWorldNews. https://t.co/N6PX4MAjBa pic.twitter.com/AD0zONIFlp\u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) February 24, 2022 Attacks have been launched across Ukraine, while forces are amassing near the Belarus/Poland border (Picture: Metro.co.uk) Satellite images show military forces near the western Belarusian city of Brest (Picture: Reuters) Moscow is said to have assembled more than 50 heavy equipment transporters at a training area in near the city (Picture: Reuters) But Blinken said there is \u2018something very powerful standing in the way\u2019 of a Russian advancement across Europe. He told ABC news that Article Five of NATO\u2019s founding treaty would mean that an invasion of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary or Romania would automatically drag the US, UK, France, Canada and other members into conflict. Blinken added: \u2018An attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO. The president has been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.\u2019 He said this would be the \u2018most powerful deterrent\u2019 against Putin stretching his forces beyond Ukraine. But whatever happens, the top diplomat says he is \u2018convinced\u2019 that Putin is going to try and overthrow the Kyiv government.

As it amassed as many as 190,000 troops along the Ukrainian border in a matter of weeks, Russia continually denied plans to invade. But it demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine is never allowed to join NATO, as it feels the pact has expanded too far eastwards and poses a security threat. While Ukraine has received reports from the alliance\u2019s members and has contributed to NATO missions, it is not immediately close to joining. First Ukraine would need to improve its political and legal systems and rid them of corruption. The country has also faced fighting from pro-Moscow separatists since 2014 \u2013 meaning it is far too unstable to be considered for NATO any time soon.

(Photo by Daniel Pockett/Getty Images) Tennis world number one Daniil Medvedev says he wants to \u2018promote peace\u2019 all around the world after his home nation Russia launched an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Russia has spent months amassing soldiers along the Ukrainian border and president Vladimir Putin instigated a full scale violent assault on multiple cities in the early hours of Thursday morning which has drawn furious condemnation from the international community. Some Russian people have reacted with protests in cities including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and various national celebrities have condemned the violence. Now US Open champion Medvedev says he is in favour of peace rather than war. \u2018By being a tennis player I want to promote peace all over the world,\u2019 the 26-year-old said after defeating Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori at the Mexican Open. \u2018We play in so many different countries.

The 61-year-old is making the film in association with VICE World News and Endeavor Content, according to a VICE spokesperson, who declined to provide any further details about the project. Penn arrived in Kiev on Thursday to \u201ctell the world the truth about Russia\u2019s invasion\u201d of its neighbor, with the Office of the President of Ukraine announcing the actor\u2019s arrival. Penn was seen at a press briefing in the presidential office in Kiev on Thursday, and was also briefly featured in an Instagram story posted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Volodymyr Zelenskyy/Instagram The Ukrainian government has expressed gratitude to Penn, writing in a statement: \u201cThe director specially came to Kyiv to record all the events that are currently happening in Ukraine and to tell the world the truth about Russia's invasion of our country. Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine today. Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty.\u201d The statement went on to contrast Penn\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d against the inactivity of some of Ukraine\u2019s Western partners in the face of the military operation launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Penn had previously visited Ukraine back in November 2021 to work on another documentary about the Donbass and \u201cRussian aggression.\u201d Back then, he visited the eastern regions of the country and spoke to servicemen.

However, while both men were reporting on the ongoing conflict, they had to take cover and cut back to the studio in London as explosions continued in Ukraine.\u00a0 John explained: \u2018We were going to come to you just a few minutes earlier, but there was a long and loud barrage of what I believe is incoming artillery fire.\u00a0 \u2018It could have been rockets, it felt very close to the centre of\u2026 there\u2019s one.

Russia-Ukraine war: Everything you need to know Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared war on Ukraine, with rocket strikes destroying swathes of the country. As of Thursday night, 137 people were killed and a further 316 have have been wounded. However, these numbers are expected to be significantly higher as bombing continued throughout the night and Russian troops have begun to storm the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv.

        "content": "Flight tracker reveals empty skies above Ukraine as military conflict intensifies, UK flights banned from Russian airspace International airlines have stopped flights over Ukrainian territory with the escalation of Russian military activity in the country. A warning has been issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for commercial flights to avoid Ukrainian airspace as well as areas within 100 nautical miles (185km) of the Russian and Belarus borders. \u201cIn particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,\u201d the EASA said. \u201cThe presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.\u201d In a later-issued update, the regulator advised airlines to \u201cexercise caution\u201d deep inside Russia.Russia suspended domestic flights to and from several airports near its border with Ukraine, including Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and Stavropol, until March 2. The step taken \u201cto provide safety\u201d for civil flights left dozens of planes grounded in southern Russia. Read more Ukraine crisis sends global markets plummeting The EASA said Russia\u2019s defense ministry had sent Ukraine an urgent message warning of a high risk to flight safety due to the use of weapons and military equipment, and asked Ukraine\u2019s air traffic control to stop flights. The US Federal Aviation Administration echoed the warnings by expanding an area in or near Ukraine where American airlines cannot operate. According to the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, skies above crisis-torn Ukraine have turned empty as nations halted flights over major safety concerns. As a result, airlines skirted the entire country in crowded corridors to the north and west, leaving a big hole on the aviation map. The data shows that an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto made a U-turn out of Ukraine\u2019s airspace around the time of its closure, while a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv also turned back. Kyiv-bound flights operated by Air India and Aegean Airlines soon followed suit. Screenshot \u00a9 flightradar24.com Ukraine International Airlines diverted one Kyiv-bound flight to Moldova while some of its planes remained grounded in Kyiv. Last week, the carrier sent part of its fleet to safety abroad. Meanwhile, Hungary\u2019s Wizz Air said it was trying to evacuate Ukrainian-based crew, their families and four aircraft.

London included Russian airlines in a package of sanctions imposed to punish Russia for its military attack on Ukraine. The crunch will inevitably cast a shadow over a wider travel demand for the third northern summer in a row, after two years of severe restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It was forbidden to issue foreign currency in cash to banks, but the measure does not apply to those government-linked institutions. The head of the central bank, Kirill Shevchenko, has assured that the flow of cash to ATMs would not be limited, and non-cash payments were also not subject to restrictions.\u00a0Ukrainian citizens have flooded the country's ATMs in an attempt to withdraw their money as the conflict with Russia intensifies.

Read more UEFA officially strips Russia of Champions League final The step comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine. Putin said the step was to defend the populations of the newly-recognized republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, and to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine. Ukraine and its Western allies have condemned the move, with the fallout continuing to spill over into sport.

As of Thursday night, 137 people were killed and a further 316 have have been wounded. However, these numbers are expected to be significantly higher as bombing continued throughout the night and Russian troops have begun to storm the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv.

To him, Trump was \u2018too unpredictable\u2019 for Putin to take such a risk. It comes at Russian missile strikes on Ukraine continued through the night, including on the capital Kyiv. As of Thursday night, 137 were killed and 316 wounded, but there are fears this number will have risen significantly in fresh fighting. Sharing his thoughts on Friday morning, the former Good Morning Britain presenter slammed the response from other countries, branding Germany\u2019s \u2018frankly pathetic\u2019 and accused others of \u2018punishing Putin\u2019s oligarch friends\u2019 instead. He also heavily criticised Putin, and after earlier ripping apart the \u2018bully-boy\u2019 leader in a blistering takedown, he added to it during an appearance on Australia\u2019s Today show. When asked by hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon for his musings, he said: \u2018My thoughts are this has been coming, Vladimir Putin is a KGB gangster thug, he wants to restore the Soviet Union to, in his eyes, its former glory, and it\u2019s going to criminally invade countries until we stop him.\u2019 Piers doesn\u2019t think Putin would have invaded under Trump (Picture: Alexei Nikolsky\\\\\\\\TASS via Getty Images) Piers went on to suggest Putin is \u2018gonna take Ukraine, I would imagine quite quickly\u2019, adding: \u2018Because nobody has the military will or desire to try and stop him there,\u2019 noting the actions taken by leaders so far seemed to be \u2018punishing his rich mates\u2019. He went on: \u2018How does that stop someone with Putin\u2019s megalomaniac ambition? He\u2019s a supreme narcissist, he\u2019s a dangerous guy, he\u2019s a killer and what he\u2019s doing in Ukraine is an absolute disgrace. \u2018The Ukrainian people deserve a lot more than what they\u2019re getting right now from a tepid, timid world looking at this and going \u201cisn\u2019t this awful, let\u2019s punish some of his oligarch friends\u201d.\u2019 Asked who had the might to stand up to Putin, Piers conceded it was America, but that he didn\u2019t believe President Joe Biden had the power, especially following the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year which, to Piers, \u2018handed the country to the Taliban\u2019. Trump was \u2018too unpredictable\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images) He said: \u2018Putin\u2019s testing not just the world, but essentially, he\u2019s testing America, have you got the stomach for the fight,\u2019 before adding China \u2018will be watching this\u2019 situation unfold as well, wondering whether the response from the US will determine if they try to \u2018take Taiwan\u2019. Piers explained: \u2018Then we\u2019re into a world war situation, which would be catastrophic. The world has to come together. \u2018Putin has to lose, he has to lose badly, he has to be shamed and humiliated and kicked out of Ukraine with his tail between his legs. \u2018I just worry who has the will to do it?\u2019 As the topic of nuclear weapons came up, the journalist hoped \u2018cooler heads will prevail\u2019 before it comes to that, but described Putin as \u2018a dictator in the classic form\u2019: \u2018He wants to restore the Soviet Union, he wants all those countries back under his power. \u2018What we\u2019re seeing now is the manifestation of weak policies, an overreliance on their energy, which gives him a financial hold\u2026 \u2018The way Germany has responded has been frankly pathetic, because they feel financially paralysed by their reliance on Russian energy.\u2019 Piers didn\u2019t hold back (Picture: NINE) Talk then turned to Trump, and how the former US President, who lost the 2020 election to Biden, would have responded to Putin and the invasion of Ukraine, after he suggested it \u2018wouldn\u2019t happen on his watch\u2019. \u2018He may have a point,\u2019 Piers said. \u2018He\u2019s said some stupid things in the last week about Putin being a genius, but one thing he was probably right about was that there was an unpredictability about Trump that deterred people like Putin and North Korea from doing anything because they thought \u201cwe\u2019re not quite sure how he\u2019ll respond\u201d. \u2018There\u2019s no unpredictability from Joe Biden, he\u2019s an old guy who\u2019s showing his age, I think he\u2019s had a disastrous first year in office and what he did in Afghanistan was rank cowardice.\u2019 Piers went on: \u2018To be fair to Trump, and it\u2019s difficult to be fair to Trump\u2026I think on the foreign stage he was not a warmonger. Trump didn\u2019t go to war anywhere, he always thought wars were a senseless waste of money\u2026 \u2018Would it have happened if Trump had been president? I doubt it. \u2018I doubt Putin would have done this. I think he\u2019s done it because he senses in Biden a weak leader at a weak time.\u2019 Piers\u2019s words come after troops poured in from the Crimean peninsula and assaulted border guards head on along the eastern and northern borders. Video footage shows tanks forcing their way through border checkpoints on Thursday morning, with Ukrainian border force claiming that a number of guards were injured.

The View host, 79, stirred outrage with tone-deaf comments only hours after Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine. On Thursday\u2019s edition of the talk-show, co-host Sunny Hostin, 53, was sharing some facts about the warfare in Eastern Europe, as thousands of Ukraine people planned their evacuations from what would later become a warzone. Yet Behar clearly missed on reading the room, and led the discussion towards her plans to travel to Italy, a country 1,500 miles away from the unfolding situation. Hostin began: \u2018Estimates are 50,000 Ukranians will be dead or wounded and this is going to start a refugee crisis in Europe. We\u2019re talking about 5million people that are going to be displaced. \u2018It\u2019s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.\u2019 But Behar avoided further commentary on eastern Europe, and turned her focus west: \u2018I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s going to happen in western Europe, too. \u2018You plan a trip, you want to go there, I\u2019ve wanted to go to Italy for four years and I haven\u2019t been able to make it because of the pandemic and now this. \u2018It\u2019s like, what\u2019s gonna happen there?\u2019 Behar\u2019s comments sparked outrage on social media, with one viewer writing: \u2018Did Putin even stop to think how his invasion would affect Joy Behar\u2019s trip to Italy?\u2019 Another joked: \u2018You almost have to respect Joy Behar\u2019s unwavering commitment toward ensuring that boomers are the most hated generation alive.\u2019 Behar\u2019s concerns for her trip to Italy sparked outrage on social media (Picture: The View / ABC) A third added: \u2018The true horror of the worldwide pandemic and Russia invading Ukraine? Joy Behar hasn\u2019t been able to take her trip to Italy. Thoughts and Prayers for Joy. We hope she makes it through this tragedy.\u2019 One user commented: \u2018Is it possible for Joy Behar to be any more tone deaf?\u2019 Will send her some positive vibes while I play my tiny violin. pic.twitter.com/4PTVsmc4qu\u2014 LiketheHurricane (@CELPbytheSea) February 25, 2022 pic.twitter.com/SYXQyRyVFM \u2014 Rachel Dzanashvili (@rachel_dz) February 25, 2022 Someone need to start a GoFundMe to send joy to Europe. \u2014 \ud83e\udd89 (@Marry_Jake) February 24, 2022 Please Make A Wish get in touch with @JoyVBehar so we can make this Italy trip happen \u2014 Crypto Rich \u2013 Cash Broke (@MasseyJos) February 25, 2022 She can\u2019t catch a break.

Earlier, responding to a tweet by a relative of one of the 20 students stranded in Ukraine, the state minister requested the Indian embassy in Ukraine to reach out to them. One Epuri Raghavendra tweeted that 20 Telangana students, including his brother, are waiting for help in Vinnytsia. He wrote that students are very scared and helplines in Ukraine are not responsive. They disconnected the call by saying present location of students is very faraway for help. The Telangana government has set up helplines at Telangana Bhavan New Delhi and State Secretariat Hyderabad to help the students and citizens of the state who are stranded in Ukraine. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar on Friday held a teleconference with the Principal Secretary, General Administration, Vikas Raj and Resident Commissioner Telangana Bhavan Gaurav Uppal and took stock of the situation. The helplines have so far received 75 calls. The chief secretary said that the state government is in constant touch with the External Affairs ministry, Government of India and taking all steps to ensure the safety and security of the Telangana people. Efforts are also being made to ensure that all the stranded persons are evacuated and they reach the state safely, he said.",

        "description": "The opposition Congress targeted the BJP government in the state, accusing it of inaction and delay in evacuating students and other Indian citizens stuck in the eastern European country",
        "content": "Nearly 2,500 students from Gujarat are stranded in Ukraine amid Russia's military operation, a state minister said on Friday. Talking to reporters, Education Minister Jitu Vaghani said Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel has been in touch with the Centre to ensure the safe return of the stranded students to the state. The opposition Congress targeted the BJP government in the state, accusing it of inaction and delay in evacuating students and other Indian citizens stuck in the eastern European country, while the ruling party said the Centre is doing everything possible for the safe return of the Indians, including the students from the state. \"Nearly 2,500 students from Gujarat are in Ukraine at present. The Indian government has been concerned about all its citizens since the very beginning. CM Bhupendra Patel is in constant touch with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the Prime Minister's Office to ensure safe return of Gujarati students and other citizens from the state, who are based in different parts of Ukraine,\" Vaghani said. He said that as instructed by the chief minister, state Chief Secretary Pankaj Kumar spoke to the Foreign Secretary on Thursday and the state government has also opened a control room to provide guidance and information about the latest situation in Ukraine. \"Apart from the contact numbers provided by the Centre, people living in Gujarat can dial 079-23251900 to seek any information or help. I urge people stuck in Ukraine to be in touch with the Indian Embassy. I am confident that the Indian government will find a way to evacuate Indians just like we did in the past,\" the minister said. Unhappy with the Centre's response to the crisis, Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil on Friday asked the Modi government to come out of the election mode. \"The Congress had asked the Centre to start the process of evacuation a week ago. But it did nothing. The BJP government should come out of the election mode and think about those who are still stranded. As an alternative to the air route, we can evacuate Indians by shifting them to European countries using roads,\" Gohil said. Several students from Gujarat who are studying in Ukraine have been making desperate appeal for evacuation for the last few days. Russian forces on Thursday launched a military operation against Ukraine following weeks of tension between the two neighbouring countries.",

Taking to Instagram, the 35-year-old said: \u2018Please pray for my husband Maks. \u2018I don\u2019t usually ask these things from my social media network, however today is extremely hard and the next few days will be even harder. https://www.instagram.com/p/CaYF5Owvj9X/ \u2018My pain is overwhelming and I\u2019m struggling but you sending your positive light and love to him would mean the world to me.

On Thursday, a devastated Maksim shared videos from Kyiv as he looked out across the capital from a balcony, while sirens could be heard ringing out around him. In one video, Maksim teared up as he panned his camera along the city as sirens rung out incessantly. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CaXEYnAgr_b/?utm_source=ig_embed His voice broke as he continued: \u2018Honestly, I\u2019m getting really emotional, it\u2019s been a little difficult. You know me, I stay strong and I don\u2019t show it. \u2018But I want to go back home. And I realize that I have the way to. I realize that I have a different passport, and my family is far away.

        "content": "Barack Obama said Vladimir Putin had acted \u2018in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency\u2019 (Picture: Getty; AP) Barack Obama has condemned Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine \u2013 days after his successor Donald Trump branded the Russian president a \u2018genius\u2019. The former US president released a statement on Thursday, hours after Russia began its offensive by land, air, and sea following a declaration of war. Mr Obama accused Russia of launching \u2018a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency\u2019. He went on: \u2018Russia did so not because Ukraine posed a threat to Russia, but because the people of Ukraine chose a path of sovereignty, self-determination, and democracy. \u2018For exercising rights that should be available to all people and nations, Ukrainians now face a brutal onslaught that is killing innocents and displacing untold numbers of men, women, and children.\u2019 Mr Obama added: \u2018People of conscience around the world need to loudly and clearly condemn Russia\u2019s actions and offer support for the Ukrainian people. \u2018And every American, regardless of party, should support President Biden\u2019s efforts, in coordination with our closest allies, to impose hard-hitting sanctions on Russia \u2013 sanctions that impose a real price on Russia\u2019s autocratic elites. \u2018There may be some economic consequences to such sanctions, given Russia\u2019s significant role in world energy markets. But that\u2019s a price we should be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom.\u2019 Mr Obama\u2019s statement in full (Picture: Barack Obama/Twitter) Another former president, George W Bush, called Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine \u2018constitutes the gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II\u2019. He said: \u2018I join the international community in condemning Vladimir Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. \u2018We cannot tolerate the authoritarian bullying and danger that Putin poses. Ukraine is our friend and democratic ally, and deserves our full support during this most difficult time.\u2019 Their strong condemnations of Mr Putin contrasted with the remarks of Mr Trump, who called the Russian leader a \u2018genius\u2019. He told the conservative \u2018Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show\u2019 earlier this week: \u2018I said, this is genius: Putin declares a big portion . . . of Ukraine as independent. How smart is that? And he\u2019s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That\u2019s [the] strongest peace force.\u2019 More: Donald TrumpTrump is a 'nauseating, fearful pig' for calling Putin 'pretty smart': Biden staffer saysDonald Trump says Putin is a 'genius' after 10,000 Russian troops invade UkraineDonald Trump's Truth Social app 'prohibits disparaging him' despite 'free speech' promise Mr Trump has not spoken since the invasion started. Leaders of the 30 Nato allied nations will meet on Friday, current US President Joe Biden confirmed, as they come under pressure to go even further than sanctions already announced to hit the Kremlin. In the US, Mr Biden also announced extra sanctions to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, with more troops deployed to Germany to bolster Nato. \u2018Putin is the aggressor,\u2019 Mr Biden said. \u2018Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at\u00a0webnews@metro.co.uk.

He said that steps would be taken to relocate students from Ukraine to other parts of the world by special flights and later shift them to India.Earlier on Friday, Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting with his superiors on the safe repatriation of Telugu people stranded in Ukraine. CM Jagan also wrote a letter to the Foreign Minister asking him to take steps to bring back the Telugu.Meanwhile, Telugu students in Ukraine are facing difficulties in the wake of Russian attacks. It remains to be seen how long these attacks will last and how the situation will change. The Telugu students there told the hat the impact of the Russian attacks had begun, that the main roads had been closed and that the ATMs were being closed.Nearly 20,000 Indian students are studying at the universities of Zephrozia, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariappal in Ukraine. It is estimated that there are more than 3 thousand people from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states. Most of them are students doing MBBS. Ukraine's climatic conditions are similar to those in India, where students are better educated. However, the problem for Telugu students started in the wake of the Russian attacks on Ukraine. The parents are appealing to politicians to make arrangements to bring their children safely.",

        "description": "Both of the Slavic race, and the Orthodox Christian Church, Russians and Ukrainians (or at least half of them) have been linked since Kievan Rus emerged in the 9th century.",
        "content": "Moscow: Just ahead of the military action in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin had, in an address to his nation (and the world), termed Ukrainian statehood a \"fiction\" and attributed the very existence of modern Ukraine to Bolshevik leaders in wake of the 1917 Revolution.Political rhetoric may not need to be accurate, but there is no doubt that Russia and Ukraine have long and intertwined historical and cultural affinities. For starters, the first names of both the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents - Vladimir and Volodymyr (Zelensky) - are variants. And then, guess where famous Russians such as the writer Nikolai Gogol, and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev were born? Or where did Nikita Khrushchev, who can be blamed for a lot of the present-day problems in this connection - handing over the Crimean Peninsula from Russia to Ukraine in the 1950s - begin his career? Both Russia and Ukraine can be said to have emerged as independent nations after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991, but the latter was - along with Belarus (or Byelorussia then) - a separate member of the United Nations from its inception after World War II. Both of the Slavic race, and the Orthodox Christian Church, Russians and Ukrainians (or at least half of them) have been linked since Kievan Rus emerged in the 9th century, and both claim it as a birthplace of their modern cultures, religion, and language, with the Russian state centred around Moscow only coming up a few centuries later. After the breakup of Kievan Rus in the 12th century and consequent subjugation by the Mongols, there was no Ukrainian \"state\" as such till the 20th century. The historical reality, spanning a millennium of changing religions, borders and peoples, and politics, is much more complex, if not confusing - and explains why the eastern and western parts of Ukraine are different in culture and even religion. Much of the latter was even a part of Poland - for about 20 years - following World War I, and before that, under the Austro-Hungarian Hapsburg Empire. The rest was a part of the Tsarist empire - and then the Soviet Union. Any good history book can tell you about the tortuous fate of the territories that comprise present-day Ukraine, in the last five centuries or so under various empires and regimes, there are some more nuances that need to be explored. First, despite historically close political and cultural ties, Ukraine was never Russified to the same extent as Belarus (where Belarusian is now spoken only by about 10 per cent of the population). And then, the Ukrainians are not enthused by the autocratic rule of both the Tsars and the Commissars - especially, Stalin, who is blamed by them for the devastating famine caused by the collectivisation drive in the early 1930s, which is still remembered as the \"Holodomor\" (death by hunger) that left at least 4 million of them dead. Then, take the name of Ukraine itself - it is derived from \"krai\", an Eastern Slavic-origin word that can mean both \"edge\" or \"borderland\" - still in use in Russia, as in Primorsky Krai - the southeastern-most part of Russia, bordering China and North Korea. A section of scholars, however, contend that \"krai\" can also mean \"country\" or, even, \"homeland\". Historically, Ukraine was sometimes referred to as \"the Ukraine\", but this is considered incorrect or even offensive now - as U.S. President George H.W. Bush once learned to his cost. The problem is rooted in grammar. In Eastern Slavic (both the Russian and Ukrainian languages), the preposition \"na\" (as in the English transliteration) is used to refer to regions or areas, while \"v\" (transliterated) is used to refer to proper nouns or definite locations. Until 1991, Ukraine could be referred to using \"na\", but most Ukrainians have now switched to \"v\", but the Russians stubbornly still use \"na\". This leads to Ukrainians thinking that the \"na\" user doesn't consider Ukraine a \"real\" country, although there are some Ukrainians who use \"n?\" either out of habit, or they just don't see it as an issue. A complicated relationship, made more so by present events, the Russian-Ukrainian connection seems to keep on being interesting - not to mention impactful - for the wider world.Also read: Ukraine Asks Its Citizens To Leave Russia ImmediatelyAlso watch:\u00a0",

The WWE legend has been criticised for a \u2018tone deaf\u2019 tweet referencing the titular character from his HBO series, who debuted on screen in James Gunn\u2019s 2021 film \u2018The Suicide Squad\u2019 and is known for being brash and jingoistic while remaining committed to peace at any cost. Hours after news emerged that Russia had invaded Ukraine, he tweeted: \u2018If I could somehow summon the powers of a real life #Peacemaker, I think this would be a great time to do so.\u2019 Many fans slammed the actor for his tweet, particularly given that it included a sponsored hashtag for the show.

They said: \u2018I hope you didn\u2019t mean to come off as disrespectful by using this to promote your show . You don\u2019t have the powers of peacemaker but you do have the power of money and status.

A number of stars have condemned the attack, including former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T23S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/24\\/17\\/54611673-0-image-a-75_1645723970711.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-24T17:32:40+0000\",\"description\":\"The prime minister has pledged support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/24\\/3963196942542024779\\/480x270_MP4_3963196942542024779.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \u2018This is an act of war by a bully-boy thug who doesn\u2019t think the rest of the world has the guts or will to stop him,\u2019 he wrote in one post. \u2018Shameful.\u2019 In a separate tweet, he added: \u2018Putin\u2019s doing this because he got away with it last time in Crimea.

        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin on Thursday appealed to the Centre to arrange special flights like the Vande Bharat Mission to immediately evacuate Tamil Nadu students stranded in Ukraine, following the Russian offensive against the Eastern European country. Urging the Centre to take up the matter with the authorities there immediately, Stalin said, \"I request the Government of India to arrange for Special Mission flights like Vande Bharat Mission to evacuate them from various parts of Ukraine. I solicit your urgent action in this regard,\" he said in a letter addressed to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. The Chief Minister said that about 5,000 students from Tamil Nadu, mostly in professional courses and other emigrants from the state were now stranded in Ukraine. \"We have been receiving hundreds of distress calls from the family members of the students studying in Ukraine requesting for their urgent evacuation. However, it has come to our notice that airports in Ukraine are closed. They are in need of our support to be brought back to India safely,\" the chief minister said in the letter. For its part, the state government has opened 24x7 help desks and appointed a state Nodal Officer to facilitate the evacuation of stranded Tamils in Ukraine to coordinate with the government of India, their families and district administration. \"Considering the high number of Tamilians in Ukraine it is requested that a Nodal Officer may be nominated for coordination with the Tamil Nadu government. I request the Government of India to take up this issue with the authorities there for evacuating them out of Ukraine immediately,\" Stalin urged Jaishankar. Meanwhile, with Ukraine closing its airspace to civilian flights following Russia's military action in that country, the state government has appealed to the stranded students not to venture out but remain in touch with the Indian embassy there, a senior official said. The sudden closure of airspace and mounting tension has made the students and their parents in the state panicky. \"We have asked the students stranded in Ukraine not to venture out but remain in constant touch with the Indian embassy there,\" Jacintha Lazarus, director of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils, told PTI.",

She helped plan the gathering, along with Melanie McCutchan who also has Ukrainian ancestry. \"As an American, I would be out here anyway even if this wasn't personal because Putin is a threat to democracy around the world,\" McCutchan said. Some of the people had no connection to Ukraine, and there were others who support Ukraine despite being Russian. \"I'm appalled at what's going on. This aggression of Russia against Ukraine was totally unprovoked,\" said protestor Alexander Allan. Allan lived in Russia before the fall of the Soviet Union. But he has friends who are Ukrainian and doesn't back Putin. \"We're here all together supporting Ukraine and actually condemning Putin,\" Allan said. Latest on Russia-Ukraine Crisis Some people say they're grateful they live here in the United States where they are free to protest the invasion. \"I heard today in Russia there were Russians protesting against all of this, and they got beaten and carted of prison,\" McCutchan said. \"I cherish this right to come out and speak and be free, and that's all Ukrainians want.\" Many attendees of the protest say they will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.",

(KRON) - The Consul General of Ukraine in San Francisco works to build international relations and promote the interests and needs of their home country, an especially important role after the invasion of Russian troops. Odesa isn\u2019t just the site of multiple bombings in Ukraine, but also where Dymtro Kushneruk\u2019s parents live. The Consul General of Ukraine is concerned for his family and others who are in the middle of a war zone. \u201cLike throughout the day they\u2019ve been going in and out of the bomb shelters according to alarms and no alarms,\" Kushneruk said. Kushneruk says that Ukraine may be the victim of Russia\u2019s invasion, but is also a resilient place. He\u2019s happy to see President Biden\u2019s sanctions on Russia but says they don\u2019t go far enough. \u201cWe need even stronger ones because Russia has committed a crime against humanity by starting this war against the European country and peaceful country Ukraine,\" Kushneruk said. He\u2019s hoping that by next week, Congress votes to impose legislation calling for stronger sanctions to isolate Russia from the civilized world. Although the invasion of Urkaine is happening more than 6,000 miles away, Kushneruk says it\u2019s a war everyone should be paying attention to, not just politicians. \u201cUkraine is a democracy and Ukrainians stand for their freedom and the united states has always stand for freedom, especially California. So everyone should care,\" Kushneruk said. Kushneruk says that accounts have been set up through Ukraine\u2019s national bank for humanitarian needs and to support the country\u2019s military.",

That is according to his mother who has been keeping in touch with him from their home here in the Bay Area. How long has the Bay Area resident in Ukraine been on the road? \"They've been on the road since basically the attack started. I forget exactly what hour that was,\" said Debbie Alter-Starr who is the mother of the Napa man evacuating Ukraine. 5 things to know as Russia presses into Ukraine Cellphone video shows people evacuating on foot from Ukraine during day one of the Russian invasion. The video was recorded by Aaron Starr, the 26-year-old Napa resident in Ukraine with his Ukrainian girlfriend. Alter-Starr says she's been in contact with her son. \"I actually did talk to him about an hour ago, because I was trying to figure out how to be the most supportive to him,\" she said. Alter-Starr made her remarks around the time President Joe Biden made his first address to the nation announcing the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. She says during her recent conversation with her son, he made it a point to talk about the people in the video. \"People walking with just a backpack,\" Alter-Starr said. \"Lines of people walking while he is sitting in this car driving to safety. (My son) is not at safety yet. He is not over the Polish border, but I am proud of him for focusing on other people and drawing our attention to what really matters - which is drawing our attention to this humanitarian crisis. \"I think it is really important not to let the threat dominate your life.\" These are thoughts Aaron Starr shared during this Inside Edition interview earlier this week. Ukrainian American Council in Bay Area calls for help Alter-Starr has hopes her son will be alright. \"Well, I am obviously, you know, really counting the minutes until they cross the border,\" Alter-Starr said. \"His girlfriend's sister lives there. I know that will be a solace to her because she had to leave family and friends. That they take care of themselves. That they do what they need to.\"",

        "content": "(The Hill) \u2013 As Russian forces marched deeper into Ukrainian territory on Thursday, Western leaders responded with condemnation and a fresh round of sanctions. President Biden\u00a0said Moscow\u2019s invasion represents a clear effort to expand its reach that must be confronted. \u201cThe Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity. This is a premeditated attack,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThis was never about a genuine security concern on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin\u2019s desire for empire by any means necessary.\u201d\u00a0 Here are five things to know. \u200b\u200b1. Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine from nearly all sides Russia launched its invasion early Thursday morning Moscow time, with a directive from President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0ordering a military operation that quickly led its forces to attack from multiple points along the Ukrainian border. Explosions were heard across the country as Russian forces entered by land, air and sea. Russian tanks were seen moving south from the Belarusian border, the closest entry point for reaching Kyiv, passing through the radioactive Chernobyl exclusion zone along the way. Missiles also targeted Ukrainian military control centers in the capital. A Western intelligence official\u00a0told\u00a0Bloomberg News that\u00a0Kyiv could fall to Russian forces as early as Thursday night, saying that Ukrainian air forces have been largely taken out. The Russian military also launched strikes in the east, where Putin claimed intervention was needed to protect the area from the Ukrainian \u201cregime.\u201d\u00a0 In the south, amphibious forces launched attacks in the port city of Odessa, killing 18 Ukrainian soldiers, according to reports. Russia has embarked on a massive disinformation campaign, falsely claiming, among other things, that it is entering the country to combat genocide \u2014 accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish and lost family members in the fight against Germany in World War II, of Nazism. \u201cRussia propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat,\u201d Biden said in his Thursday address at the White House. 2. Ukraine vows resolve in confronting Russia against large-scale invasion\u00a0 Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova on Thursday reinforced the nation\u2019s resolve even while describing a 13-hour offensive against the country by Russia that targeted with bombs its infrastructure, airports, warehouses, facilities and even civilian hospitals.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The combat spirit of Ukrainian military is high,\" she said. \"We are fighting, we will be fighting \u2014 not only our brave and motivated military but all Ukrainians.\" U.S. military and intelligence leaders are expecting a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, one that will involve overtaking significant territory. \u201cHe has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about,\u201d Biden said Thursday. Outlets have reported multiple casualties on both sides. Images of Ukrainian highways near Kyiv showed roadways flooded as people left the capital following explosions. The city has since imposed a curfew, ordering residents to remain in their homes from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. Multiple reports have detailed rushes at ATMs and grocery stores emptied as Ukrainians stock up on food, as well as long lines at gas stations. Ukrainian institutions were also the target of multiple cyberattacks, including ones targeting banks and the government\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\u00a0 Biden warned that Russia is unprepared for the long-term consequences of trying to occupy the country. \u201cHistory has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil disobedience and strategic dead ends,\u201d he said. 3. What happens next? The Biden administration on Thursday\u00a0announced a second round of sanctions\u00a0against Moscow targeting more of its financial institutions, Russian elites, their families and businesses. The president also restricted exports of key technology critical for Russia\u2019s defense industry and blocked other countries from exporting to Russia commodities that include U.S.-made software or equipment.\u00a0 Biden on Thursday described the sanctions as \u201cprofound\u201d but warned that their impact will likely take at least a month to inflict real pain on the Kremlin.\u00a0 In the meantime, the administration is bracing for punishing cyberattacks from Russia, with efforts already seen in Ukraine likely to now be targeted at the U.S. and Europe. Other forms of retaliation could be deadly. Secretary of State\u00a0Antony Blinken\u00a0warned on Feb. 17 during a speech at the United Nations Security Council that Russia sought to target specific Ukrainians for violence. The U.S. mission to the United Nations circulated a Russian \u201ckill list\u201d\u00a0in a letter among member states of the international body as a warning of Putin\u2019s possible war crimes.\u00a0 \u201cAs we have said\u00a0\u2014 if what was described in our letter transpires, those would be horrific crimes\u00a0\u2014 war crimes, even,\u201d a State Department spokesperson told The Hill on Wednesday. \u201cWe have been warning individuals and groups who we think could be targeted based on our understanding and our knowledge of Russian plans to try to enable them to protect themselves or move to places where they might be safer.\u201d European leaders are also preparing for what could be a massive exodus of refugees, with U.S. intelligence agencies assessing that anywhere from 1 million to 5 million Ukrainians could be displaced as Russian forces enter the country from the north, south, and east. The office of U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees said several thousand Ukrainians have already crossed into countries like Moldova and Romania, while an estimated\u00a0100,000 are now displaced within the country,\u00a0according to\u00a0Reuters. 4. A divided global response between U.S. and Russia allies The U.S., Europe and\u00a0Group of Seven leading industrial\u00a0countries largely aligned on Thursday with statements of strong condemnation against Putin for launching a war against Ukraine.\u00a0 Secretary-General of the United Nations\u00a0Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued an appeal directly to Putin: \u201cStop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia.\u201d China, however, rejected characterizing Russia\u2019s attacks against Ukraine as an invasion in a predictable split from the U.S. position. Chinese officials repeated Putin\u2019s claims that Moscow launched a \u201cspecial operation\u201d and reiterated its statements for \u201call sides\u00a0... to exercise restraint and take constructive steps to ease the situation.\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian tweeted support on Thursday for Russia\u2019s narrative of the attack against Ukraine, saying the crisis is \u201crooted in NATO\u2019s provocations.\" Likewise, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan landed in Moscow to meet with Putin on Wednesday night and carry out a two-day visit, where Pakistani and Russian officials committed to closer ties to strengthen their economies, and technology and energy sectors. India, a democracy and that is a key partner of the U.S. in military cooperation, offered tempered responses on Thursday, drawing calls for help from the Ukrainian ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, who said in a press conference that Kyiv is \u201casking, pleading, for the support of India.\u201d\u00a0 Biden on Thursday said the U.S. is in consultation with India over their response to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, saying Washington and New Delhi \u201chaven't resolved that completely.\u201d 5. Americans and Europeans brace for economic impact Financial sanctions on the Russian energy sector could wallop the country\u2019s most economically and geopolitically important industries, but at the risk of higher gas and energy prices for U.S. and European consumers.\u00a0 Russia is a significant source of U.S. energy imports and a key supplier for European nations who may lean harder on America to make up for fuel unavailable from Russia. The nation\u00a0was the third-biggest supplier of foreign petroleum for the U.S in 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, responsible for 7 percent of imported oil. Oil\u00a0reached\u00a0more than $100 a barrel\u00a0Thursday morning.\u00a0 In announcing the latest round of sanctions Tuesday, Biden warned that American consumers would be affected\u00a0\u2014 a hardship he said was necessary in order to confront a global bully. \u201cI know this is hard, that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse.\u201d",

        "content": "The Ukrainian president says Kiev is left to fend for itself as NATO is \u201cafraid\u201d to give Kiev any guarantees Accusing the West of leaving Ukraine to face Moscow alone, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday he was not afraid to negotiate about ending the Russian \u201cinvasion,\u201d but would need security guarantees to do so. Speaking in the early hours of the morning from Kiev, Zelensky said he had reached out to \u201cpartners\u201d in the West to tell them Ukraine\u2019s fate was at stake. \u201cI asked them \u2013 are you with us?\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cThey answered that they are with us, but they don\u2019t want to take us into the alliance. I\u2019ve asked 27 leaders of Europe, if Ukraine will be in NATO, I\u2019ve asked them directly\u00a0\u2014 all are afraid and did not respond\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe were left by ourselves. Who is ready to go to war for us? Honestly, I don\u2019t see anybody. Who is ready to give Ukraine guarantees of NATO membership? Honestly, everybody is afraid,\u201d the Ukrainian president added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Thursday, with President Vladimir Putin declaring a special military operation to \u201cdemilitarize and de-nazify\u201d Ukraine. Moscow has since told Kiev that it would consider negotiating with the Zelensky government if it agrees to discuss neutral status for the country, among other things. In an address on Friday, Zelensky said that he is open to talk about Ukraine\u2019s potential neutral status, but insisted that his country needs third party guarantees.\u00a0 \u201cWe are not not afraid of Russia, we are not afraid to talk with Russia, talk about everything: security guarantees for our country and a neutral status. But we are not in NATO now \u2013 what security guarantees will we have? Which countries will give them?\u201d he said, before adding that there should be talks that could bring an end to the Russian military offensive. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that \u201cneutral status and rejection of hosting [offensive] weapons systems\u201d are Putin\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d for Ukraine and that the ball was now in Kiev's court.\u00a0",

        "content": "ArmA III, a video game that in the right circumstances can look pretty realistic, has a long history of turning up on news broadcasts and being either confused with or intentionally used in place of actual camera footage of real-world events. That trend is continuing in the current crisis in Ukraine. As Bloomberg report, some of the most-viewed videos on Facebook\u2019s gaming channel today were a number of clips purporting to be of military action taking place in Ukraine, \u201cwatched by more than 110,000 people and shared more than 25,000 times\u201d before they were taken down by Facebook. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The same videos are also circulating on other social media, including Twitter; here\u2019s one of the clips, posted with the text \u201cUkraine fires missiles to intercept Russian aircraft\u2019s artillery fire\u201d, though really it\u2019s some Arma III footage: UPDATE: Twitter has now removed both the video and the tweet itself, though you can see a part of it in the gif at the top of this story. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); At time of posting that tweet has 11,000 likes and almost 2000 retweets. It\u2019s easy for you and I to sit here and say \u201cwell of course that\u2019s a video game\u201d, but not everyone is familiar with ArmA\u2019s attention to detail and visual fidelity. And remember, the smaller/blurrier these videos get on social media, the easier they are to pass off as actual footage. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); This also speaks to a wider problem that anyone who has been online in the last 24 hours (or last 10 years) will have seen unfolding: any coverage of the invasion that allows input from the community is overflowing with opportunists looking for engagement (no matter how inaccurate the content they\u2019re actually sharing is) and agents seeking to confuse and direct attention away from what\u2019s actually happening. It makes it hard to be able to tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not when looking at this stuff online, which is why sites like Facebook (see below) are trying to actually do something proactive and real-time for once, using human beings, to try and moderate things: 1/ In response to the unfolding military conflict in Ukraine, we have established a Special Operations Center to respond in real time. It is staffed by experts (including native speakers) so we can closely monitor the situation and act as fast as possible. \u2014 Nathaniel Gleicher (@ngleicher) February 24, 2022 Like I said, this isn\u2019t the first time ArmA III footage has been misused in a time of crisis. Russian news was caught using it for a story on Syria in 2018 and tried passing it off as a \u201chuman error\u201d, though Russian use of video game footage in 2017 to allege the US was supporting ISIS didn\u2019t help their case. Use this as a reminder that if you\u2019re looking at stuff about Ukraine on social media, check then triple-check the sources and content before engaging with and/or sharing it.

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) - As war enters Europe and the Biden administration announces new sanctions on Russian financial institutions and oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin, Florida braces for the impact it could have on gas and food prices. \"It's just a very volatile market right now and then when you introduce a situation like this with Russia and Ukraine, it just adds to the volatility, it adds to the concern in the market which is ultimately driving prices higher,\u201d said Mark Jenkins, a AAA spokesperson. Tampa Bay area students worry about family in Ukraine U.S. crude oil prices rose overnight, ticking close but not exceeding the $100/barrel mark. Worldwide crude oil prices did cross that threshold. The oil and gas industry has seen a tumultuous few years as the pandemic prevented people from traveling and cut demand. Companies have been trying to ramp up production again as demand increased. \u201cWe\u2019re already in a crude oil market that\u2019s extremely tight. Supplies are tight and if there\u2019s concern that Russia\u2019s oil might be affected in some shape or form to where that oil leaves the market, then that has a big impact on global supplies,\u201d said Jenkins. Russia is one of the world\u2019s top oil and natural gas suppliers. Prices fluctuated throughout the day but trended lower after President Joe Biden announced his new sanctions package, which did not target Russian oil or gas companies, according to Jenkins. Ukrainian students at USF hope for the best as loved ones remain in Europe \"We're taking active steps to bring down the cost and American oil and gas companies should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits,\u201d said President Biden. The President said the U.S. was ready to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve alongside its allies. \u201cI know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me but this aggression cannot go unanswered,\u201d said President Biden. The uncertainty could still lead to price increases at the pump but it is unknown by how much. Meanwhile, Ukraine is often referred to as the \u201cbreadbasket of Europe,\u201d accounting for 12% of the world\u2019s total wheat exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A supply chain expert from the University of South Florida says this conflict could be felt at the dinner table. \"That may impact some of the wheat related products that we are using as far as the grocery shops are concerned,\u201d said Dr. Seckin Ozkul. \u201cIf our, basically, wheat supply is reduced, I will expect some price hike but hopefully not so much.\u201d Gas and heating costs could rise if Russia invades Ukraine, analysts say The U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says U.S. wheat farmers will boost production and prevent supply chain problems if the invasion chokes off Ukraine\u2019s agriculture economy. Dr. Ric Rohm, a professor of business and leadership at Southeastern University said consumers may consider any invasion-related price increases to just be more inflation. \u201cDon\u2019t panic at the grocery store. Don\u2019t panic at the gas pump. You remember the toilet paper shortage during the pandemic. There was plenty of toilet paper around it\u2019s just we all bought it and then it wasn\u2019t in the stores and that kind of accelerated everybody\u2019s fear,\u201d he said.",

The post Here\u2019s Why Russia\u2019s Invasion of Ukraine Is Pushing up Petrol Prices in Australia appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.",
        "content": "Global crude oil prices have already reached their highest levels since 2014 in response to Russia\u2019s military incursion into Ukraine. With Russia being the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of crude oil and refined petrol, as well the world\u2019s largest exporter of natural gas, we can expect prices to go even higher as the conflict deepens. Skittish global energy markets are now factoring in disruptions to Russia\u2019s supply through Western sanctions as well as Russia cutting off to supplies to Europe, its main market for both oil and gas. Australians will feel these market anxieties too, with changes in retail prices largely determined by international price benchmarks for refined petrol. It typically takes more than a week for changes in international prices to flow through to retail prices in Australian cities, and longer in regional areas. But based on what is happening internationally we can expect petrol prices in Australia to soon reach an average of $2.10 a litre. How are petrol prices set? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Australia meets its petrol needs through either refining crude oil locally or (increasingly) importing refined petrol. Two decades ago, eight local refineries were able to supply most of Australia\u2019s petrol demand. Now there are just two, producing less than 10% of Australia\u2019s petrol needs. This means 90% of refined petrol is imported \u2013 principally from Korea, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia and China. As in other importing countries, the price Australians pay at the petrol pump therefore has three main components: the international price of refined petrol government taxes other transportation, marketing and retail costs, including a profit margin. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, which closely scrutinises petrol prices, says the international price is the main determinant of price changes. The following chart shows the relationship between average retail prices in Australian cities and the benchmark price for 95-octane unleaded petroleum in Singapore, the largest oil trading exchange in our region. (The fuel is called Singapore Mogas 95 \u2013 \u201cmogas\u201d meaning motor gasoline.) Monthly average retail petrol prices in the 5 largest cities and Mogas 95 prices in real terms: October 2001 to November 2021 ACCC window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Taxes are the second-biggest component. These consist of an excise and the goods and services tax. GST is 10% of the retail price (or 1/11 of the total price paid). As of February 2022, the excise was fixed at 44.2 cents a litre, so it doesn\u2019t change with the retail price. Assuming a petrol price of $1.90/litre, taxes would comprise about a third of the cost. The tax Australians pay on petrol is among the lowest in the OECD group of advanced economies. The remainder of the retail price includes supply chain costs and profit margins for refiners, wholesalers, distributors and retailers. The amount motorists pay as profit is less than 10 cents a litre. Global ripples Australia may not import crude oil or petrol from Russia. But the world oil market behaves as one great pool, where changes in market conditions in one area quickly affect other geographic areas. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); More than half of Russia\u2019s oil exports and most of its natural gas exports go to Europe. Russia provides about 30% of Europe\u2019s crude oil and refined petrol imports and 40% of it natural gas imports. In response to Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine, Germany has already moved to halt a new gas pipeline being laid in the Baltic Sea between Russia and Germany. Market watchers worry the Russian gas that flows across Ukraine to Europe could also be shut off. This would lead to severe shortages in some countries and drive up the price of gas as well as other fuels, such as oil. There is also considerable pressure to ensure economic sanctions imposed on Russia are not undermined by Moscow continuing to profit from its oil and gas trade. Analysts from the Brookings Institution, for example, have argued for sanctions on Russian energy exports. What we can expect Two weeks ago, when the global benchmark oil price was just above US$90 a barrel, JP Morgan predicted the price would reach US$125 a barrel. This week Goldman Sachs analysts tipped that \u201coutright conflict\u201d coupled with \u201cpunitive sanctions\u201d will increase oil prices by 13%. The five-city average Australian petrol price was near A$1.70 per litre when the benchhmark oil price was US$90 per barrel. This suggests an increase to US$125 a barrel would lift average Australian city prices to as much as $2.10 per litre.

Tonight, it has been claimed that US officials reportedly believe that Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, could fall within a few days, as the city mobilises its military forces to defend itself from the Russian attack. Demonstrators have flooded the streets of Russia in their thousands to protest the offensive, amid the news that 57 people had been killed on the first day of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On the late night edition of BBC News, Myrie provided an update on the attack Russia has launched against Ukraine \u2018by land, sea and air\u2019, stating that \u2018fierce fighting is taking place\u2019. The reporter informed viewers of the air strikes that were followed by the land invasion by Russian forces, saying that they \u2018breached the border in three main directions from the east, the south and the north\u2019. As he introduced the BBC News international correspondent Orla Guerin, a tear appeared to fall down his cheek, a moment that was noticed by several people watching the news programme.

        "content": "\u2716The Simpsons showrunner offered a statement on what's going on with comparisons to the Russia and Ukraine conflict. Once again, fans of the show are pointing to the Fox sitcom as another predictor of a historical event. This time, instead of Murder Hornets or the pandemic, online spectators are gesturing toward the brewing situation in Ukraine. The Hollywood Reporter managed to catch up with Al Jean to ask about the significance of the show and it's focus on history for the weird predictions. Obviously, the show runner views everything that's going as a tragedy. People are always wondering how these moments continue to materialize in history especially over the last few years. (The effects of record numbers of viewers being inside to rewatch the series probably has something to do with that too.) Check out how Jean approaches the phenomenon down below.\"In terms of predictions, there are two kinds we have: The trivial, like Don Mattingly getting in trouble for his hair in 'Homer at the Bat,'\" Jean explained. \"And then there are predictions like this. I hate to say it, but I was born in 1961, so 30 years of my life were lived with the specter of the Soviet Union. So, to me, this is sadly more the norm than it is a prediction. We just figured things were going to go bad.\"\"Historical aggression never really goes away, and you have to be super vigilant,\" he adds. \"In 1998, when this clip aired, it was maybe the zenith of U.S.-Russia relations. But, ever since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin got in, almost everybody has made it clear that he's a bad guy and bad things are going to happen.\"ComicBook.com previously spoke to Jean about the predictions that surprised him most. He settled on a moment around 2001. \"There was one crazy cell where Bart held up a brochure that is 'New York on $9 a day,' the World Trade Center, this was 1996, was in the background, so it looked like a '9/11,' that was insane, and of course unplanned and a terrible coincidence,\" he said. \"That's the one where I go, 'What was that? That was bizarre.' Most of the other things are educated guesses. Donald Trump was running for president and we predicted Lady Gaga's halftime show by looking at her earlier costumes, so that was not that hard.\"{replyCount}commentsDid you see any of those posts circulating on social media?

        "content": "Protests against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have begun across the US (Pictures: AP/Getty/AFP) Protests against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have already begun taking place in several major US cities on Thursday, hours after Russia launched its widely anticipated invasion of Ukraine. The first protest took place outside Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington DC around 1am Thursday, just after news broke that Russian forces began attacking their neighbor. Dozens of protestors turned up early this morning in the capital region, where they waved Ukrainian flags and chanted \u2018stop Russian aggression.\u2019 Among the first demonstrators were people originally from Ukraine, many still with family members there, WUSA reported. People gather outside the Russian Embassy protesting the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Picture: AP) Some were teary-eyed, hoping that the embassy would have more information about the invasion and how to support each other. One man told the outlet he came to the US nine years ago from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and that his entire family is still there. He said he had been pleading with his parents and sister for weeks to leave and get to safety, but now doesn\u2019t know what he can do to help them. Roxolana Wynar said she felt she had to come out to make her voice heard. \u2018Different cities throughout Ukraine are currently being bombed, and people are being displaced, and it\u2019s horrible. We\u2019re here to protest to stop this war and to show the world that we\u2019re not going to stand by and do nothing. We\u2019re going to unite, and we\u2019re going to call on the US government to do more and our allies to do more to stop this war,\u2019 Wynar said. Protestors gather in New York in freezing temperatures and marched to the Russian mission to the United Nations (Picture: Getty Images) Despite frigid temperatures, hundreds of protestors in Manhattan marched to the Russian mission to the United Nations. Some wore Ukrainian flags while others chanted: \u2018Stop the war.\u2019 New York City has the largest Ukrainian community in the US. Anstasiia Yashchenko, a resident of Kyiv, told Reuters that her loved ones back home were at the top of her mind while she attended the protest with her boyfriend, who had flown her to New York 10 days ago. \u2018I packed everything in like two suitcases and I just ran out of the apartment and just left,\u2019 said Yashchenko. The 23-year-old said she had hoped tensions would lesson, and could not believe her eyes while watching the news of the invasion unfold early Thursday morning. Many of the protestors in DC were Ukrainians, who went to the embassy to see if there were any updates on the invasion (Picture: AP) her family and friends were foremost on her mind while she attended the protest with her boyfriend, who had flown her to New York City 10 days earlier. \u201cI packed everything in like two suitcases and I just ran out of the apartment and just left,\u201d said Yashchenko, 23. She said she had hoped tensions would lessen, and could not believe her eyes when watching the invasion unfold early Thursday. Additional protests were scheduled for later on Thursday in Washington, Los Angeles, Houston, and Denver, according to social media posts. Similar rallies took place in cities around the world on Thursday, including in Russia, where over 1,600 people have been detained at anti-war protests, according to Reuters.

Macron reportedly urged an end to Russian military operations in Ukraine, while Moscow described the call as a \u201cserious exchange\u201d of views, ending with an agreement to stay in touch. The telephone conversation initiated by the French late on Thursday evening consisted of a \u201cserious and open exchange of opinions about the situation in Ukraine,\u201d the Kremlin said in a readout.\u00a0 Putin gave Macron \u201can exhaustive explanation of the reasons and circumstances for the decision to conduct a special military operation,\u201d and the two leaders \u201cagreed to remain in contact.\u201d The Putin-Macron call apparently became the first call between the Russian leader and a head of a western nation after Moscow announced it was sending troops into Ukraine early on Thursday. According to the Elysee Palace, as cited by AFP, Macron called Putin on behalf of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to \u201cdemand an immediate halt to Russian military operations\u201d and remind the Kremlin that \u201cRussia was exposing itself to massive sanctions.\u201d Read more Biden imposes \u2018long-term impact\u2019 sanctions on Russia over Ukraine At a meeting on Thursday afternoon, the EU announced sanctions on the Russian financial, energy and transportation sectors, imposition of export controls and visa limitations, as well as restrictions on a number of Russian individuals. This followed US President Joe Biden announcing \u201cstrong sanctions\u201d on Russia, which he said were designed to have long-term crippling impact on the Russian economy. This does not include cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT international banking system, which Biden said some European allies of Washington objected to. The US president argued that his measures were \u201cstronger\u201d than a SWIFT ban. The UN, US, and EU have accused Russia of an \u201cunprovoked\u201d aggression against Ukraine. Announcing the military operation on Thursday morning, Putin said its objective was to \u201cdemilitarize and de-nazify\u201d Ukraine. The Russian military has confirmed it carried out strikes on military infrastructure all over Ukraine, insisting that the attack is not aimed at civilians.",

        "description": "Ukraine\u2019s Health Minister Viktor Lyashko says 57 Ukrainians have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion, and 169 more were wounded.",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early Friday as Russian forces pressed on with a full-scale invasion that resulted in the deaths of more than 100 Ukrainians in the first full day of fighting and could eventually rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. After using airstrikes on cities and military bases, Russian military units moved swiftly to take on Ukraine\u2019s seat of government and its largest city in what U.S. officials suspect is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime. Ukrainian leaders pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, and hotels in Kyiv were being evacuated amid early indications of an assault. Democrats, Republicans unite behind Biden\u2019s sanctions Ukrainian forces braced for more attacks after enduring for hours a Russian barrage of land- and sea-based missiles, an assault that one senior U.S. defense official described as the first salvo in a likely multi-phase invasion aimed at seizing key population centers and \u201cdecapitating\u201d Ukraine\u2019s government. Already, Ukraine officials said they\u00a0had lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster. In unleashing the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, Putin ignored global condemnation and cascading new sanctions. With a chilling reference to his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, he threatened any country trying to interfere with \u201cconsequences you have never seen,\u201d as a once-hoped for diplomatic resolution now appeared impossible. \u201cRussia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won\u2019t give up its freedom,\u201d Zelenskyy tweeted. His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he pleaded Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days. Zelenskyy said in a video address that 137 \u201cheroes,\u201d including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. The dead included all border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which was taken over by Russians. He concluded an emotional speech by saying that \u201cthe fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.\u201d He also said the country had heard from Moscow that \u201dthey want to talk about Ukraine\u2019s neutral status.\u201d U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, saying Putin \u201cchose this war\u201d and had exhibited a \u201csinister\u201d view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly. \u201cIt was always about naked aggression, about Putin\u2019s desire for empire by any means necessary \u2014 by bullying Russia\u2019s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause,\u201d Biden said. Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to \u201creconstitute the Soviet empire.\u201d Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv\u2019s subway stations. Taiwan reports nine Chinese aircraft in defense zone At times it felt almost cheerful. Families ate dinner. Children played. Adults chatted. People brought sleeping bags or dogs or crossword puzzles \u2014 anything to alleviate the waiting and the long night ahead. But the exhaustion was clear on many faces. And the worries. \u201cNobody believed that this war would start and that they would take Kyiv directly,\u201d said Anton Mironov, waiting out the night in one of the old Soviet metro stations. \u201cI feel mostly fatigue. None of it feels real.\u201d The invasion began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north. Zelenskyy, who had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, appealed to global leaders, saying that \u201cif you don\u2019t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.\u201d Though Biden said he had no plans to speak with Putin, the Russian leader did have what the Kremlin described as a \u201cserious and frank exchange\u201d with French President Emmanuel Macron. Both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other\u2019s aircraft and military hardware, though little of that could be confirmed. Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-unused Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle, presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been\u00a0\u201cno casualties or destruction at the industrial site.\u201d The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks. Alyona Shevtsova, adviser to the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, wrote on Facebook that staff members at the Chernobyl plant had been \u201ctaken hostage.\u201d The White House said it was \u201coutraged\u201d by reports of the detentions. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an update saying that though the plant was \u201clikely captured,\u201d the country\u2019s forces had halted Russia\u2019s advance toward Chernihiv and that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved its planned Day One military objectives. The chief of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said the \u201cbrutal act of war\u201d shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders decrying an attack that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government. The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket. Condemnation came not only from the U.S. and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond \u2014 and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin. 9 ways to help Ukrainians amid Russia crisis British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he aimed to cut off Russia from the U.K.\u2019s financial markets as he announced sanctions, freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets. \u201cNow we see him for what he is \u2014 a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,\u201d Johnson said of Putin. The U.S. sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, Biden said, but they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe. Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and West to go further and cut the Russians from the SWIFT system, a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world. The White House has been reluctant to immediately cut Russia from SWIFT, worried it could cause enormous economic problems in Europe and elsewhere in the West. While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the U.S. and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the U.S. was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO. European authorities declared the country\u2019s airspace an active conflict zone. After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin launched the operation on a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow\u2019s sway. The autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy. Ukrainians were urged to shelter in place and not to panic. \u201cUntil the very last moment, I didn\u2019t believe it would happen. I just pushed away these thoughts,\u201d said a terrified Anna Dovnya in Kyiv, watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell. \u201cWe have lost all faith.\u201d With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground. Russia and Ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming \u201cpilot error,\u201d and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew. It did not say how many were aboard. Russia said it was not targeting cities, but journalists saw destruction in many civilian areas. Poland\u2019s military increased its readiness level, and\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0and Moldova moved toward doing the same. Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a false claim the U.S. predicted he would make as a pretext for invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees, saying the military action was a \u201cforced measure.\u201d Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle. In a reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, he warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d",

The 28-year-old midfielder then lifted his jersey to reveal an undershirt in support of his home nation, which has been under attack from Russia.\u00a0\u00a0Malinovskyi\u00a0devastated\u00a0Olympiakos\u00a0with his left foot, scoring two goals for Atalanta in a 3\u20130 win that helped his side advance to the last 16 on a 5\u20131 aggregate. The second was just as clinical as his first, with\u00a0Malinovskyi curling his shot into the opposite corner from distance.Malinovskyi came up through the Shakhtar Donetsk system before also playing for Ukrainian sides Sevastopol and Zorya Luhansk. While at Belgian side Genk, he made his Ukraine senior debut and has since recorded 45 caps and six goals.\u00a0Malinovskyi's national teammate Roman Yaremchuk made a similar gesture in support of Ukraine on Wednesday in Champions League. After his equalizer for Benfica against Ajax, Yaremchuk removed his jersey to reveal the Ukrainian coat of arms.Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian teammate\u00a0Oleksandr Zinchenko issued a death wish to Russian president Vladimir Putin in an Instagram post that was later removed. According to\u00a0The Independent, the Manchester City wingback wrote,\u00a0\u201cI hope you die the most painful suffering death, creature.\u201dSolidarity was found elsewhere across the Europa League on Thursday, too. Before its Europa League game against Sevilla, Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb supporters displayed a sign that read \"Support to the people of Ukraine.\"\u00a0Meanwhile, Barcelona and Napoli players joined together to hold up a sign that said \"STOP WAR\" before their Europa League second-leg match in Italy.\u00a0More Soccer Coverage:Ukraine Star Zinchenko Issues Death Wish for Putin in Instagram PostPoland, Czech Republic, Sweden Refuse to Play World Cup Qualifiers in RussiaReport: UEFA to Move Champions League Final From RussiaBenfica's Yaremchuk Celebrates Goal By Revealing Ukrainian Coat of Arms",

Most of the casualties are believed to be soldiers, although at least 10 civilians including one child are believed to be among the dead. The Russian military claims there is \u2018no threat to civilian population\u2019 as it is not targeting cities and using precision missiles. But several towns and cities in eastern Ukraine have all been struck by shelling, including Chuhiv, where an apartment block several miles from a military base was destroyed by a missile. Emergency services said a young boy was killed in the explosion, while many more residents were pictured with serious injuries in the aftermath. A tally from official Ukrainian sources previously compiled by the AFP news agency put the death toll at 68.

        "content": "Members of the mission will be temporarily evacuated due to the deteriorating security situation The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) announced on Thursday evening that it will evacuate members of its monitoring mission from Ukraine after Russia launched a military attack in the country. \u00a0\u201cDue to the ongoing fighting and the deteriorated security situation in Ukraine \u2026 I have decided to temporarily evacuate all international mission members from Ukraine as soon as possible,\u201d OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid said in a statement. \u201cThe safety of the dedicated women and men who serve as impartial eyes and ears of the international community on the ground throughout the country is imperative,\u201d she added. OSCE monitors were deployed to eastern Ukraine in 2014 to record ceasefire violations along the so-called \u2018contact line\u2019 separating the Ukrainian Army and the forces of two breakaway republics in the Donbass region. Read more Russian military attack on Ukraine: How we got there Russia recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) as independent states on Monday, citing what it argued was Kiev\u2019s inability to implement the ceasefire. Russia also accused Ukraine of shelling the DPR and LPR. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the Russian military began hitting military targets in Ukraine to protect the people of the Donbass. He added that he seeks the \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d of Ukraine. Kiev has denied violating the ceasefire and said that attacks from Russia were unprovoked. On Thursday, Ukraine said it was cutting all diplomatic ties with Russia and appealed to its Western and other allies to respond more harshly to Moscow.",

        "content": "Some Prince Albert residents are experiencing a true nightmare as Russia invades Ukraine. Anton Shapofhmya was born and raised in Ukraine but moved to Canada five years ago where he currently lives with his wife. His parents and two of his siblings still live in the country. In the words of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Russia conducted an \u201cegregious attack\u201d on Ukraine Wednesday night. Explosions have been seen across several major cities including in the country\u2019s capital Kyiv. Shapofhmya told paNOW he\u2019s been in contact with his family and believes they\u2019re safe for now. \u201cMy family\u2019s not in a city, they\u2019re on a farm in a little village. I think it\u2019s safer.\u201d He added they were caught off guard by the invasion. They believed Russia was only going to take the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized each area\u2019s independence. \u201c(Putin) told everybody he\u2019s not going to open the war in all of Ukraine\u2026 but he did completely different from what he said.\u201d Meanwhile, Taras Kachkowski with the Prince Albert Veselka Ukrainian Organization has been dealing with a flood of different emotions. \u201cI\u2019m worried, I\u2019m angry, I\u2019m enraged. I\u2019m all of that altogether, all at once. It\u2019s something that I thought we\u2019d never have to go through again and here we are.\u201d He added he has some friends in the capital city of Ukraine, which he worries could soon be littered with Russian military forces. He hopes world leaders, including Canada, will act swiftly and send a message that Russia\u2019s invasion is not ok. \u201cThis is a terrorist regime that wants to recreate the USSR/Russian empire under this madman\u2019s control. He\u2019s not going to stop at Ukraine, and he has to be stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs to come together and do what\u2019s necessary, including sharp sanctions and declaring the Russia Rogue State and Putin a terrorist in charge.\u201d \u201cThe time for hand ringing and trying to distance oneself from this is over, it\u2019s happening, whether you want to (believe it) or not, and the world needs to react strongly to deter it.\u201d On Thursday, Trudeau announced a slew of economic sanctions against Russia which will target the country\u2019s elite, members of the Russian Security Council, and key cabinet ministers. He announced the federal government is prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine. Canada has also arranged for the safe passage of any Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families still in Ukraine through land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. \u2013With files from The Canadian Press \u2014 panews@pattisonmedia.com On Twitter: @princealbertnow",

        "content": "AnnaLynne McCord shared a poem on social media after Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukraine (Picture: Getty) 90210 actress AnnaLynne McCord has recited a poem to President Vladimir Putin after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Russia launched airstrikes across the country in the early hours of this morning, with troops crossing the Crimea border. President Putin gave the order for his invasion to begin, and issued a chilling warning to world leaders over a reaction, stating that they will \u2018face consequences greater than any in history\u2019 if they interfere. Following the news, 34-year-old AnnaLynne shared a video on Twitter over the atrocities. In the two-minute long clip, she recited a poem for the camera, directed towards Putin. \u2018Dear President Vladimir Putin, I\u2019m so sorry that I was not your mother,\u2019 she began. \u2018If I was your mother you would have been so loved, held in the arms of joyous light, never would the story\u2019s plight the world unfurled before our eyes, a pure demise of nations sitting peaceful under a night sky. Dear Mister President Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 pic.twitter.com/LbDFBHVWJf\u2014 AnnaLynne McCord (@IAMannalynnemcc) February 24, 2022 \u2018If I was your mother, the world would have been warm. So much laughter and joy and nothing would harm. I can\u2019t imagine the stain, the soul stealing pain, that the little boy you have seen and believed, and the formulation of thought quickly taught that you lived in a cruel unjust world.\u00a0 \u2018Is this why you now decide no one will get the best of you? Is this why you do not hide nor away shy from taking back the world. Was it because so early in life, all that strife wrapped your little body with fear.\u00a0 She continued: \u2018If I was your mother, if the world was cold I\u2019d have died to make you warm. I\u2019d have died to protect you from the unjust, the violence, the terror, the uncertainty, I would have died to give you life. Oh Dear Mr President Putin, if only I\u2019d been your mother.\u00a0 \u2018Perhaps you would hold dear human life and on this night instead of Mother Russia, you would call me and I would set your mind quite free with the love that only a mother can give. AnnaLynne directed her poem to President Vladimir Putin (Picture: Getty) \u2018And only a mother to take away, when holds she doesn\u2019t harm at bay and leaves her boy for the promise of a man. Whatever your story, Mr President Putin, I can\u2019t imagine how it feels in your heart but I know if I was your mother, I would be a start. \u2018Towards the awareness of what a powerful being of light you could be if your mind was only free from the violence you\u2019ve seen when you were just two or three. I cannot believe I was born too late. In a different place when I would have loved you so, watched you play wherever you go.\u2019 The video has been watched more than 670k times and has left many divided, with fans questioning AnnaLynne\u2019s decision to speak out, while others praised the brief clip. Her post comes after Putin gave the order for troops to cross the Crimea border. Joe Biden has spoken out over the attacks (Picture: AFP) The Kremlin\u2019s troops have captured Chernobyl during the invasion, following heavy fighting with defending troops. Following the news, President Joe Biden spoke out on the situation, describing Putin as \u2018the aggressor\u2019 as he announced sanctions on Russian banks. \u2018Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences,\u2019 he said, before revealing sanctions on four more major Russian banks in addition to the \u2018first tranche\u2019 of sanctions that included two Russian financial institutions.\u00a0 More: Soaps18 new Emmerdale images reveal Meena's 'escape' plan, secret exposed and passionHollyoaks spoilers: John Paul vows to give up alcohol after shouting at Matthew-JesusReunion revealed for Nancy and Zack in EastEnders \u2018That means every asset they have in America will be frozen,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with\u00a0Russia\u00a0in Ukraine. \u2018Our forces are not going to\u00a0Europe\u00a0to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.\u2019 Biden vowed to protect every inch of Nato territory, adding: \u2018Make no mistake \u2013 freedom will prevail.\u2019 Got a story?

        "description": "Moscow is trying to end the eight years of bloodshed in Ukraine that the West wasn\u2019t concerned about, MFA spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry says it wants to end the 8-year bloodbath in Donbass that both Ukraine and the West turned a blind eye to The West spent eight years ignoring the \u201csea of blood\u201d in Donbass while arming Ukraine, and now claims Moscow is the aggressor when it stepped in to end the conflict, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told RT on Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday, claiming it was necessary to \u201cdemilitarize and de-nazify\u201d the neighbor. Kiev accused Russia of aggression, while the US, EU and NATO have called it an \u201cunprovoked\u201d invasion. Moscow insists this is not the case. In announcing the operation, Putin said the \u201cmain objective is to stop the escalation of the war that\u2019s been going on for eight years, and to stop the war,\u201d Zakharova told RT in an exclusive interview. \u201cRussia did not commit aggression of any kind,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova insisted. \u201cThis did not start yesterday. There\u2019s a sea of blood that\u2019s appeared over the past 8 years,\u201d she added, referring to the conflict in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which Russia on Monday recognized as independent states. The main aim is to stop the escalation of the war that\u2019s been going on for eight years, to stop\u00a0this war Donetsk and Lugansk broke away from Ukraine in 2014, after the West-backed coup ousted the democratically elected government in Kiev. Zakharova noted that the two self-proclaimed republics held a referendum eight years ago, saying they did not want to remain in Ukraine, but both Moscow and the West rejected this and tried to put the \u201cbroken\u201d country back together. Read more Russian military attack on Ukraine: How we got there When asked about President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s statement that Ukraine wanted peace, Zakharova wondered why Ukraine was arming itself and refusing to negotiate with the Donbass. \u201cIf Ukraine wanted peace, why did they get all these weapons\u201d from all over the world, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman told RT, adding, \u201cIt was clear that these were offensive weapons. Who were they fighting? Their own people in southeast Ukraine, and spoke often about seizing Crimea.\u201d The peninsula voted to rejoin Russia in March 2014, but Ukraine and its Western backers have refused to recognize this, calling it an \u201cannexation.\u201d Zakharova also noted that the top Ukrainian officials have openly and publicly brought up the idea of obtaining nuclear weapons in recent weeks, pointing out this was a fact and not something claimed by Russian intelligence. Read more Putin will decide when Ukraine offensive ends \u2013 Kremlin Divisions in Ukraine go beyond Donetsk and Lugansk, Zakharova added, accusing armed groups with Nazi-era symbols \u2013 such as the notorious Azov Battalion \u2013 of having influence over much of the country. For years, she said, Western media so concerned over human rights in places like South Sudan and Myanmar kept silent on all this, ignoring that more than 13,000 people have died in the Donbass \u2013 many of them civilians. While Russia provided them with humanitarian aid, Kiev besieged them by cutting off trade, finance, and even utilities. Zakharova noted that the water canal towards Crimea is now once again operational after Ukraine \u201ccriminally\u201d shut it off years ago.",

        "content": "KYIV, UKRAINE \u2013 Canadian Press is reporting that an adviser to the Ukrainian Presidential Office says Ukraine has lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site to Russian forces after a fierce battle. The site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident is just 130-kilometres north of Kyiv. The nuclear reactor at the plant exploded in April 1986, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The exploded reactor was covered by a protective shelter several years ago to prevent radiation leaks. The Russian Defence Ministry is confirming its ground forces moved into Ukraine from Crimea and claims it has destroyed 83 Ukrainian military facilities. A spokesperson says forces are advancing toward Kherson, which sits on a reservoir that provided most of the freshwater for Crimea until Ukraine cut it off with a dam in response to Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. More information will be provided as it becomes available.",

        "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada imposed more severe sanctions on Russia in response to its military strike against Ukraine, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday. The new sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country\u2019s elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks. The sanctions, announced after Trudeau attended a virtual G7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones. Canada has arranged for the safe passage of any Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families still in Ukraine through land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, he said. The federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine, said Trudeau. \u201cPresident Putin has launched a horrific, unprovoked attack on their country, a sovereign nation, including missile strikes in their capital, Kyi. He has needlessly put the lives of innocent people at risk, violated Russia\u2019s international treaties, and launched the greatest threat to European stability. Since World War Two,\u201d said Trudeau. The Ukraine envoy called on Canada and its allies need to do everything it can to stop Russia\u2019s invasion of his country, otherwise \u201cWorld War Three\u201d awaits them. Ukraine\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires Canada, Andrii Bukvych, said his country wants to see Canada and the West impose crippling sanctions, cut diplomatic relations and would like to see NATO enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to prevent Russian aerial bombardment that he says is taking place. Bukvych said he believes Putin will push his military onward through NATO countries such as Poland and the Baltics if he is not stopped now. \u201cWe do understand there is a high toll that the free world economy of Western economies will pay for deterring Russia, for supporting Ukraine,\u201d Bukvych said in an interview. \u201cBut I believe that this toll is still much more less than having World War Three, which will inevitably take place unless Putin will be stopped in Ukraine,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this time, I want every Canadian to be Ukrainian because to be Ukrainian right now, to be with Ukraine right now, it means that you are fighting for your freedom.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Putin\u2019s attack was a test of the post-Second World War order that Canada helped to build to restore peace to the world. \u201cIt could be this is an extremely serious challenge to that order. And if Russia succeeds, then that order will be breached. And we can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d said Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent and has been banned by Putin from travelling to Russia because she wrote critically about him in her pre-political career as a journalist. Foreign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said more sanctions against Russia were coming. Earlier Thursday, Joly summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador for a dressing down as Trudeau huddled with other world leaders to discuss the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ambassador Oleg V. Stepanov met Joly at the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada, where she condemned \u201cin the strongest possible terms Russia\u2019s egregious attack on Ukraine,\u201d the minister\u2019s office said. Joly also told Stepanov that Russia had violated Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. Bukvych said Canada should expel the Russia ambassador. Joly said the remaining Canadian diplomats in Ukraine had been evacuated to neighbouring Poland. A joint G7 statement earlier Thursday said \u201csevere\u201d and co-ordinated economic measures and sanctions were coming against Russia. It called on the international community to condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms. On Tuesday, Trudeau announced a first round of sanctions and the deployment of hundreds of additional Canadian troops to eastern Europe after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. That limited military action was followed in the early morning hours in Ukraine on Thursday with the launch of a full-scale invasion, with missiles hitting Ukrainian cities and military facilities across the country and tanks and troops rolling in from three directions. The invasion followed a steady Russian buildup of military forces on its borders with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus over the past two months, which had sparked numerous rounds of diplomacy between the Kremlin and the West. Canadian leaders from across the political spectrum were united in condemning Russia\u2019s invasion, with interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen blasting Putin as an autocrat who \u201cwill be judged harshly.\u201d \u201cPutin\u2019s contemptible aggression and invasion of Ukraine is unacceptable,\u201d Bergen added. \u201cHis attack on the Ukrainian people and their democratically elected government is despicable.\u201d NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on the government to immediately impose severe economic sanctions \u201cwhere it hurts Putin the most,\u201d including by targeting Russian oligarchs who support him and kicking Russia from the global banking system. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, which represents 1.3 million Canadians of Ukrainian descent, echoed that call for Russia to be tossed from the banking system as part of \u201cdevastating\u201d economic sanctions. \u201cUkraine needs weapons with which to defend itself right now,\u201d UCC executive director Ihor Michalchyshyn added in a statement. \u201cMost importantly they need anti-air systems like stinger missiles and other air defence and naval defence systems.\u201d He also warned against Canada and its allies not taking a strong enough stance in its response to Russia, saying: \u201cIn the 1930s, the world was slow to recognize the danger that Adolf Hitler posed to our civilization. We cannot make that same mistake again with Putin.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 24, 2022. Mike Blanchfield and Lee Berthiaume, The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said the new sanctions will target 62 people and entities connected to Russia.

        "content": "TORONTO \u2013 Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine is putting even greater pressure on an already surging oil price environment and that will cost Canadians more at the pump. Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International Inc. expects gas prices across the country will rise five cents per litre on Saturday. He says drivers who fill up occasionally have hours to avoid extra costs but there\u2019s not much that can be done for those who fill up daily. The high demand for oil combined with a shortage of supply have been pushing oil prices, and consequently, gas prices up for weeks. The benchmark West Texas Intermediate price is sitting at US$96 per barrel after briefly trading above US$100 per barrel this morning. Brent Crude has fallen slightly to US$103 a barrel, after topping US$105 a barrel earlier the first time since 2014. Even if U.S. President Joe Biden attempts to intervene to calm oil prices the situation could get worse, according to McKnight. As of 11:40 am on Thursday, GasBuddy.com reports that the average cost of regular unleaded fuel in Lethbridge is $1.47.9 c/L, and for Alberta as a whole, $1.44.1 c/L. (The Canadian Press)",

        "description": "The Russian military op in Ukraine comes after years of diplomatic attempts to stop the bloodshed in the Donbass starting with the 2014 coup Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "Moscow says the current situation is the result of years of failed talks to end the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine after the 2014 coup in Kiev Russia began striking military targets in Ukraine early on Thursday morning, days after recognizing the independence of the two breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. Moscow insists it is protecting the people of the Donbass from Kiev\u2019s aggression, and that it was forced to resort to military means after Ukraine abandoned diplomacy in its civil conflict in the east. The escalation follows years of unsuccessful talks, broken ceasefire agreements, and a standoff between Russia and the West linked to the 2014 coup that overthrew the government in Kiev. Here are the key events of the past eight years that led to this conflict. \u2018Euromaidan\u2019 protests in Kiev end with West-backed coupMass demonstrations in Kiev, which later became known as \u2018Euromaidan\u2019 or simply \u2018Maidan\u2019 protests, began in late 2013, after then-President Viktor Yanukovich decided to delay the signing of an EU association deal. The initially peaceful protests were joined by hardline nationalists and spiraled into violent riots in Kiev and takeovers of administrative buildings across Ukraine. In February 2014, pro-Western factions overthrew Yanukovich\u2019s government, and officials with a notable pro-EU and anti-Moscow stance came to power. While the Maidan events received widespread support in western parts of Ukraine, the eastern and southern regions, which have a large Russian-speaking population and strong historic ties to Russia, came out strongly against the events in Kiev. In cities such as Odessa, the anti-Maidan protests were soon violently suppressed. In the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions and the Black Sea autonomous republic of Crimea, pro-Russian protests persisted. Crimea votes to leave Ukraine for RussiaThe Republic of Crimea and the special-status city of Sevastopol, which had continuously hosted a Russian naval base despite the entire peninsula having been transferred to Ukraine by the Soviet government in 1954, responded to the Kiev coup by holding a snap referendum in March 2014. Crimeans overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Moscow later admitted it used its forces stationed in the region to ensure security during the March events, while Ukrainian troops either switched allegiance, or left the Black Sea peninsula without incident. Kiev has refused to recognize Crimea\u2019s vote and reabsorption, as did the majority of countries around the world. The new Ukrainian government\u2019s Western allies placed restrictions on the Moscow and Crimean authorities, starting the tit-for-tat sanctions war. Conflict breaks out in DonbassIn April 2014, two regions in the historic mining area of Donbass declared independence from Kiev. The Ukrainian government responded to the formation of the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) by launching what it called an \u201canti-terrorist operation.\u201d Newly formed \u201cbattalions\u201d of volunteer fighters, many of them with nationalist backgrounds, accompanied the troops sent to deal with the rebels. The assault spilled out into months of fighting, with heavy shelling in the cities of Donetsk and Lugansk, and civilian casualties and heavy losses reported on both sides. Both Kiev and the Donbass forces accused each other of war crimes. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of directing the \u201caggression,\u201d but Moscow insisted its troops never entered the Donbass. Minsk ceasefire deals end large-scale fightingWhile the fighting in the Donbass never ceased completely, it largely stopped after the internationally brokered accords signed in Minsk, Belarus. Under the second ceasefire deal between the Ukrainian government and the rebels brokered by Russia, France, and Germany in February 2015, Kiev pledged decentralization reform, providing broad autonomy to the eastern regions. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe deployed its monitoring team along the \u201cline of contact\u201d separating the Ukrainian army from DPR-LPR forces. No reform, no peace for DonbassKiev and the breakaway republics have repeatedly accused each other of violating the Minsk agreements, but, crucially, the promised reforms have never materialized. The Ukrainian government continued branding the DPR and LPR officials as \u201cterrorists\u201d and ruled out any direct negotiations, while new rounds of talks in the same international \u2018Normandy Format\u2019 failed to produce tangible results. In February 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was \u201cnot satisfied with all provisions\u201d of the agreements, claiming Kiev and Moscow saw their implementation differently. Russia has accused Kiev of abandoning the deal altogether, as cross-border shelling continued. More than 13,000 people were killed in the conflict between 2014 and 2020, according to the UN. Road to escalation in DonbassIn late 2021 and early 2022, allegations of an imminent full-scale attack intensified both in Kiev and in the breakaway republics. Ukraine\u2019s Western allies accused Moscow of planning an unprovoked military operation that would see large swaths of the country occupied and its capital taken, while the Kremlin continued to dismiss the allegations and, in turn, accused Kiev of planning an attack in the Donbass. Last week, officials in Donetsk and Lugansk accused the Ukrainian army of launching heavy artillery across the border.\u00a0The DPR and LPR\u00a0responded with a large-scale evacuation of civilians to Russia and declared the mobilization of all military-age men. Ukraine denied it was planning a full-blown assault on the breakaway republics, blaming the DPR and LPR for the ceasefire violations. Russia recognizes Donbass republicsThe leaders of the DPR and LPR appealed to the Kremlin on Monday to recognize the two republics as independent states. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the recognition on the same day, citing what he said was Ukraine\u2019s inability to implement the Minsk agreements and the continued attacks on Donetsk and Lugansk. Putin also signed friendship treaties with the DPR and LPR, which included the provision of military assistance. Moscow launches \u2018military operation\u2019 in UkraineOn Wednesday, the Donbass republics asked Russia to help them repel the \u201caggression\u201d of Ukrainian troops. Putin responded by announcing a military operation against Ukraine early on Thursday morning. He claimed he wanted to protect the people of the Donbass from what he described as \u201cgenocide\u201d and sought the \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d of Ukraine. The president did not reveal the scope of the operation nor how long it would last. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a short statement that it was carrying out \u201cprecision strikes\u201d against Ukrainian military targets, without specifying their location. Ukrainian officials and media outlets have reported strikes in cities across the country, as well as alleged incursions by Russian soldiers and armored vehicles from several directions. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied that its ground troops have crossed Ukraine\u2019s borders. Kiev has declared martial law and closed its airspace for civilian flights. Zelensky said Kiev was cutting diplomatic ties with Moscow. What comes next?On Thursday, Putin said Russian troops \u201cdon\u2019t plan on occupying Ukrainian territories.\u201d However, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he said Moscow has recognized the whole of Ukraine\u2019s former Donetsk and Lugansk administrative regions as the DPR and LPR. Both regions have been partly controlled by Ukrainian forces since 2015. After announcing the\u00a0mobilization in Ukraine, Yuri Maximov, a senior military official in Kiev, said 46,000 reservists would join the Ukrainian army, police, and border guards. Meanwhile, President Zelensky has been pleading with his Western allies to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia. The EU, the UK, and the US were due to announce their package of anti-Russian measures later on Thursday. The US-led NATO bloc has said it would not be deploying any troops to Ukraine. After an emergency meeting on Thursday, it said it would instead \u201ctake additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defense across the alliance.\u201d Moscow had earlier cited NATO\u2019s eastward expansion and Ukraine\u2019s potential membership as a key reason for launching its military operation.",

The new sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country\u2019s elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks. The sanctions, announced today after Trudeau attended a virtual G7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers. Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones. Trudeau also says the federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine. He says Canada has arranged for the safe passage of any Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families still in Ukraine through land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova.

Russia launched airstrikes across the country in the early hours of this morning, with President Vladimir Putin warning world leaders that they will \u2018face consequences greater than any in history\u2019 if they interfere. Taking to Instagram, the Dancing With The Stars pro \u2013 who is currently in Kyiv \u2013 shared videos as he looked out across the capital from a balcony, while sirens could be heard ringing out around him. \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m in Kyiv, contrary to what I probably should\u2019ve done a while ago but again, everybody has sources and resources and I have mine. I trust my sources and no one saw this coming,\u2019 the 42-year-old told concerned fans in one video. \u2018Not that no one saw this coming, but everybody was hoping that the finality of this situation would be averted, that there\u2019s not going to be this kind of aggression and these kind of aggressive measures.\u2019 In a second Instagram video, Maks \u2013 who is married to fellow Dancing With The Stars professional Peta Murgatroyd \u2013 teared up as he panned his camera to show his view of Kyiv, with sirens blaring below. https://www.instagram.com/p/CaXEYnAgr_b/ His voice broke as he continued: \u2018Honestly, I\u2019m getting really emotional, it\u2019s been a little difficult. You know me, I stay strong and I don\u2019t show it. \u2018But I want to go back home. And I realize that I have the way to. I realize that I have a different passport, and my family is far away. What I\u2019m realising is that my friends, whose kids are here and whose moms and dads are here, they can\u2019t just escape.\u2019 The dad-of-one \u2013 who shares son Shai with his co-star \u2013 explained that he is \u2018about to go into a bomb shelter because s**t is going down,\u2019 and insisted that \u2018this is not the way we do things\u2019.

I have a passport and a way out. A lot of people here do not, and it\u2019s f**king nonsense. \u2018I love Ukraine and I had a f**king incredible pleasure to spend, on the ground, about six months now, and I\u2019ve fell back in love. I never fell out of love, but I know now who these people are. I know who this country is, what it represents, what it stands for. \u2018And it\u2019s completely not what is being portrayed to the Russian people in order to justify this invasion.\u2019 Maks shares son Shai with fellow professional dancer Peta (Picture: Getty) \u2018I\u2019m gonna do my best to try and keep you informed. I\u2019m not a journalist, I have absolutely no reason to do this other than I just want an opinion of someone else, because news is crazy and the reports have been insane,\u2019 he added. \u2018Love you all.\u2019 Troops from Russia crossed the Crimea border into Ukraine earlier today, after President Vladimir Putin gave the order for his invasion to begin.

        "content": "After the attack by Russia, the situation has only worsened in Ukraine and hundreds of Indian students who are stranded were using social media to make\u00a0desperate appeals to the government on Thursday, February 24, so that they could come back to India safe and sound.\u00a0 Many videos are emerging on social media where Indian students, with tears in their eyes, were seen urging authorities in India to make arrangements for their safe return. Now, the videos have gone viral and many public figures are even sharing them and urging the government to take action, as stated in a report in PTI. In one video, about a dozen distressed students were seen stranded at a railway station in Kyiv, the national capital of Ukraine. \"We are very worried. We are stuck at the railway station from last night. The embassy is not replying. We do not have anywhere to go, no taxi is available. No help from the embassy. What should we do?\" one of the students was seen saying in the video, as quoted in a report by PTI. In yet another video, students were seen waiting outside the Indian Embassy with their packed bags.\u00a0 According to estimates, there are over 20,000 students from India who are currently studying in Ukraine. Voices from all around India are growing louder in their appeal to the government to ensure that students come back home to India safely.\u00a0 Actor Sonu Sood tweeted that there are over 18,000 Indian students and many families who are stuck in Ukraine. He was sure that the government must be trying its best to get them back and urged the Indian Embassy to find an alternate route for\u00a0evacuation of students, he posted adding that he was praying for their safety.\u00a0 KT Rama Rao, Telangana's IT and industries minister, made an appeal to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar via Twitter so that in this time of distress, the safe return of the Indian students in Ukraine was ensured. He also mentioned that he was receiving several messages from anxious students' parents. He expressed hope that via diplomatic channels, the Government of India can work out a solution.\u00a0 \u00a0 Activists of NSUI (National Students' Union of India), Indian National Congress' student wing, staged a protest outside the Ministry of External Affairs to demand evacuation and safe return of Indian students.\u00a0 Several meetings were conducted by the top government brass handling strategic affairs to put into action contingency plans to assist those Indians who are stranded in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "content": "Sean Penn took a front-row seat at the briefing (Picture: REUTERS) Sean Penn has been pictured attending a press briefing at the at the Presidential Office in Kiev after he returned to Ukraine to film a documentary on the Russian invasion. The director has been filming a documentary about Russian aggression in the country and was last seen there in November 2021. Amid the invasion, he has now returned and was pictured in the front row of the briefing among reporters, wearing sunglasses as he listened intently. The Ukrainian government has expressed its gratitude for the project. A translated statement provided to Newsweek read: \u2018Sean Penn demonstrates the courage that many others, especially Western politicians lack. \u2018The more such people in our country now, true friends of Ukraine, who support the struggle for freedom, the sooner it will be possible to stop Russia\u2019s treacherous attack.\u2019 He has been filming a documentary on the conflict (Picture: REUTERS) Sean appeared to be listening intently (Picture: REUTERS) Sean, 61, previously met with Ukrainian military service personnel for his new project. The actor and producer visited positions near the front line with Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk area. It is reported that Milk actor\u2019s documentary will explore how the Donbas region has been impacted by the battles with pro-Moscow rebels. The actor made the visit to the settlement of Priazov. He was last pictured in Ukraine in November 2021 (Picture: REUTERS) In images shared by the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation Press Service, the I Am Sam actor was seen wearing a helmet and surrounded by military protection. Last night Russian President Vlamdir Putin finally gave the order for his troops to invade while issuing a chilling warning to the West not to interfere \u2018or face great consequences\u2019. Why is Russia invading Ukraine? Russia has been steadily building a force of up to 200,000 on the border for several months, heavily outnumbering its neighbour\u2019s army. Ukraine\u2019s military has been preparing for an assault with the assistance of Western allies but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations. The conflict between the countries began in 2014 when a popular revolution saw the pro-Moscow government in Kyiv swept away. In response, Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists forces in the eastern Donbas region declared their independence, triggering years of grinding conflict which has claimed thousands of lives. Russian president Vladimir Putin penned a long essay last year setting out his ethno-nationalist belief that Ukraine is destined to be a part of Russia, a clear warning he did not intend to stop at the Crimean peninsula.\u00a0 US and UK intelligence has long warned Russia could use a range of military tactics to attack Ukraine. Putin has kept the world guessing about his true intentions in recent months and at times has appeared to suggest a willingness to engage with diplomatic talks, despite preparing for an incursion. After weeks of rising tensions, he took a series of steps this week that dramatically raised the stakes. First, he recognised the independence of two separatist-held regions in Ukraine \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk. Then he said that recognition extends even to the large parts of the territories held by Ukrainian forces, including the major Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Finally, he asked for and was granted permission to use military force outside Russia \u2013 effectively formalising a\u00a0 military deployment to the rebel regions. He suggested there was a way out of the crisis \u2013 if Kyiv would recognise\u00a0Russia\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea and renounced its bid to join Nato. Both demands have been previously rejected by Ukraine and the West. The country is\u00a0now under heavy attack\u00a0with troops pouring in and bombs heard across several cities. Ukrainian authorities have confirmed Russian boots are on the ground inside the country after gun battles and air strikes at various points on the border. The UK government has previously said it would not help Brits stuck in Ukraine to evacuate if the country does come under attack. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged British nationals in Ukraine to \u2018leave now via commercial routes while they are still available\u2019. Got a story?

Another brief clip, shared on the same messaging app, purports to show a missile strike near the Tripolskaya power station near Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev.

Our hope is that there is a de-escalation of the situation, but in the meantime, our government is proud to provide support to the humanitarian aid effort.\u201d Ron Orr, Minister of Culture, adds, \u201cAlberta is home to more than 345,000 people of Ukrainian descent.

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 As Russian troops attacked Ukraine, world leaders reacted Thursday with outrage \u2014 one called it \u201can unjustified barbarian act\u201d \u2014 and vowed to both tighten sanctions and hold the Kremlin accountable. The turmoil from the beginning of a long-feared act of aggression rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that \u201cthis is now an active conflict zone.\u201d In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 plea to \u201cgive peace a chance\u201d came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce a military operation that he maintained was to protect civilians in Ukraine. Putin, who said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance, warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d As leaders across Asia and Europe scrambled to condemn the attack, explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Nations around the world this week have also imposed a raft of new sanctions on Russia. \u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter. \u201cWe will hold the Kremlin accountable.\u201d Moscow had massed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders. On Monday, Putin recognized the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian forces there for what he called \u201cpeacekeeping.\u201d Guterres at the U.N. disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent. The top EU chiefs said Thursday that the invasion of Ukraine \u201cwill impose massive and severe consequences on Russia\u201d and that there will be more sanctions. The 27-nation bloc had already imposed some sanctions to punish Moscow for its recognition of breakaway republics in Ukraine earlier this week. EU leaders will discuss additional and harsher punitive measures at a summit meeting later Thursday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russia\u2019s attack \u201ca terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe\u201d and \u201ca blatant violation of international law. It cannot be justified by anything.\u201d In a bulletin Thursday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said \u201cthere is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft\u201d and that \u201cthe presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.\u201d Asian stock markets were in turmoil. Market benchmarks in Tokyo and Seoul fell 2% and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3% Thursday. Oil prices jumped nearly $3 per barrel on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low. Russia seized Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 As Russian troops attacked Ukraine, world leaders reacted Thursday with outrage \u2014 one called it \u201can unjustified barbarian act\u201d \u2014 and vowed to both tighten sanctions and hold the Kremlin accountable. The turmoil from the beginning of a long-feared act of aggression rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that \u201cthis is now an active conflict zone.\u201d In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 plea to \u201cgive peace a chance\u201d came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce a military operation that he maintained was to protect civilians in Ukraine. Putin, who said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance, warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d As leaders across Asia and Europe scrambled to condemn the attack, explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Nations around the world this week have also imposed a raft of new sanctions on Russia. \u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter. \u201cWe will hold the Kremlin accountable.\u201d Moscow had massed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders. On Monday, Putin recognized the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian forces there for what he called \u201cpeacekeeping.\u201d Guterres at the U.N. disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent. The top EU chiefs said Thursday that the invasion of Ukraine \u201cwill impose massive and severe consequences on Russia\u201d and that there will be more sanctions. The 27-nation bloc had already imposed some sanctions to punish Moscow for its recognition of breakaway republics in Ukraine earlier this week. EU leaders will discuss additional and harsher punitive measures at a summit meeting later Thursday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russia\u2019s attack \u201ca terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe\u201d and \u201ca blatant violation of international law. It cannot be justified by anything.\u201d In a bulletin Thursday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said \u201cthere is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft\u201d and that \u201cthe presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.\u201d Asian stock markets were in turmoil. Market benchmarks in Tokyo and Seoul fell 2% and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3% Thursday. Oil prices jumped nearly $3 per barrel on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low. Russia seized Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala condemned the Russian attack as \u201cabsolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Eduard Heger called it \u201can unjustified barbarian act.\u201d Many world capitals were trying to determine just what was happening in the tense and fast-changing early moments of a chaotic and violent event. \u201cWe are putting all our effort into collecting the information and comprehending the situation,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said shortly after Putin\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s important and challenging to secure the safety of Japanese people (in Ukraine).

        "content": "(NewsNation Now) \u2014 It will be difficult to monitor the fluid and ever-changing situation in Ukraine as the Russian attack on the country rages on, NewsNation\u2019s Leland Vittert\u00a0said on \u201cMorning in America.\u201d Russia launched the wide-ranging attack Wednesday evening, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.\u00a0At least 40 people were confirmed dead with dozens injured. \"This is the time you've got to be really careful because the fog of war is quite real. And anything's true, but nothing's real if that makes any sense,\" Vittert said in part. \"Formally, the real invasion is underway. The fog of war is real here. And I think what we're going to see over the next 12 to 24 hours is the Ukrainians really realize the overwhelming nature of the Russian military power.\" Will the Ukraine conflict go nuclear? Experts answer In unleashing Moscow's most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, President Vladimir Putin deflected global condemnation and cascading new sanctions \u2014 and chillingly referred to his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. He threatened any foreign country attempting to interfere with \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine\u2019s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea. The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine\u2019s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone. Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that they had shot down several Russian aircraft.\u00a0 Vittert warned of the potential for misinformation and the chance of quick escalation as the world's eyes turn to Ukraine. Russia-Ukraine conflict: Watch NewsNation\u2019s live on-air coverage \"You've got the second largest, most dangerous army in the world, the Russian army, the largest land army in the world involved in this such a massive operation. They're bombing and taking on Ukrainian targets very close to the Polish border. That's exactly where US and NATO troops are,\" Vittert said. \"So the chance of miscalculation here in an escalation is really high. It's very easy to start a war.\" Putin has painted today\u2019s Ukraine as a modern construct used by the West to contain Russia despite the neighbor\u2019s inextricable links. Putin has used this reasoning as a rationale for the attacks on Ukraine. The relationship between\u00a0Ukraine and Russia has evolved in the more than 20 years\u00a0since Ukraine has become its own nation. 87% of those born after independence was declared in 1991 identify as Ukrainian while 21 percent of those born before 1991 call themselves \u201cSoviet people.\u201d But this does vary by region, 80% of Western Ukrainians want to be economically tied to the EU versus just 26% in eastern Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday announced a military operation in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \"consequences you have never seen.\" (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) Putin previously annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Vittert said that the attacks happening in Ukraine weren't a repeat of 2014. \"History doesn't necessarily repeat itself but it does rhyme. The justification is a little different in the sense that Russia is saying that the people in the red area are ethnically Russian, and have asked for the protection of the Russian military from Ukrainian aggression,\" Vittert said on \u201cMorning in America.\u201d \"So in a sense, yes, what we would think based on the way the Russian military is acting, and we see that there are more reported Russian attacks on this map, that the Russians are doing a lot more than if they just wanted to occupy the red area. There's definitely a desire to punish the Ukrainian military.\" Putin continued this narrative Thursday afternoon in an address, blaming Russia's invasion on an alleged NATO eastern expansion calling them \"fundamental threats.\" \"It is a fact that over the past 30 years, we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe,\" Putin said in part. \"In response to our proposal, we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts to pressure and blackmail. While the North Atlantic Alliance continued to expand, despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is moving and as I said, is approaching our very border.\" Russia-Ukraine conflict: Voices from the ground of the invasion As the conflict in Ukraine continues, NewsNation will bring Americans the latest developments from abroad and insights into its impact at home throughout our newscasts.\u00a0We\u2019re dropping the paywall on our live stream so it\u2019s available to everyone.\u00a0You can watch NewsNation\u2019s programming, including the latest on Ukraine, at the top of the hour\u00a0from 7-10 a.m. and 5-11 p.m. ET.

It includes missile strikes that have hit key military sites across the country and confirmed deaths of troops on either side. The service was set up in 2014, when Ukraine was invaded by Russia the first time and the Crimea was annexed. It has since been expanded to cover other conflicts, including those in Syria and Palestine, but has now come to the fore as Ukraine is under threat once again. Software is used to track what\u2019s going on and then a team of fact-checkers verify the events as reports come in.

        "content": "The Prime Minister promised a \u2018massive\u2019 package of sanctions earlier today (Picture: AFP/Getty Images) Boris Johnson has unveiled a host of new economic sanctions against Russia in retaliation over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Minister said he would \u2018exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system\u2019 by stopping them from accessing Sterling. Earlier today the Prime Minister warned that the UK and allies would respond with a \u2018massive\u2019 package of sanctions in response to Moscow\u2019s attack. He said President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime would be condemned to \u2018pariah status\u2019 after unleashing its \u2018tidal wave of violence\u2019 against its western neighbour. Russia launched airstrikes across Ukraine in the early hours of this morning, as troops and tanks crossed the border. Putin has told world leaders they \u2018will face consequences greater than any in history\u2019 if they interfere with his invasion. While NATO will not send forces into Ukraine, which is not a member of the defensive alliance.

Parts of Ukraine, including capital city Kyiv, are under attack and hundreds of civilians are already feared dead after Putin gave Russian soldiers the order to invade this morning. The Mastermind host was reporting live in Kyiv in front of St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery as sirens blared around him. Beginning the segment in normal attire, viewers quickly spotted a drastic change 10 minutes in, as Myrie and fellow BBC presenter Lyse Doucet had changed into the protective clothing. Myrie said: \u2018We heard the air raid sirens, we have put on our flak jackets. \u2018One wonders what the people of this city and indeed right across this country are now thinking. \u2018They prayed for peace and with all the diplomacy over the last few weeks and months, they hoped that would be the case. \u2018Now we are in a major conflict.\u2019 Myrie reported live from Kyiv in a flak jacket with sirens ringing around him (Picture: BBC) One viewer shared side by side images of the change on Twitter, writing: \u2018A noticeable change for @CliveMyrieBBC in the past ten minutes as sirens blare in Kyiv, Ukraine.\u2019 This is chilling.\u2014 Louise Hulland (@LouiseOnAir) February 24, 2022 Many viewers took to social media to wish him safety, with one post: \u2018This is chilling\u2019 and another adding \u2018really terrifying\u2019.

World leaders fear the invasion could cause massive casualties, topple\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent. Putin gave the West a chilling warning after declaring war this morning, as he told world leaders that they \u2018will face consequences greater than any in history\u2019 if they interfere with his invasion of Ukraine. Addressing the nation, Boris Johnson\u00a0said the world cannot allow Ukraine\u2019s freedom to be \u2018snuffed out\u2019 by what he described as a \u2018tidal wave of violence\u2019, adding that the UK and allies will respond to the Russian invasion with a \u2018massive\u2019 package of sanctions. Why is Russia invading Ukraine? Russia has been steadily building a force of up to 200,000 on the border for several months, heavily outnumbering its neighbour\u2019s army. Ukraine\u2019s military has been preparing for an assault with the assistance of Western allies but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations. The conflict between the countries began in 2014 when a popular revolution saw the pro-Moscow government in Kyiv swept away. In response, Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists forces in the eastern Donbas region declared their independence, triggering years of grinding conflict which has claimed thousands of lives. Russian president Vladimir Putin penned a long essay last year setting out his ethno-nationalist belief that Ukraine is destined to be a part of Russia, a clear warning he did not intend to stop at the Crimean peninsula.\u00a0 US and UK intelligence has long warned Russia could use a range of military tactics to attack Ukraine. Putin has kept the world guessing about his true intentions in recent months and at times has appeared to suggest a willingness to engage with diplomatic talks, despite preparing for an incursion. After weeks of rising tensions, he took a series of steps this week that dramatically raised the stakes. First, he recognised the independence of two separatist-held regions in Ukraine \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk. Then he said that recognition extends even to the large parts of the territories held by Ukrainian forces, including the major Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Finally, he asked for and was granted permission to use military force outside Russia \u2013 effectively formalising a\u00a0 military deployment to the rebel regions. He suggested there was a way out of the crisis \u2013 if Kyiv would recognise\u00a0Russia\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea and renounced its bid to join Nato. Both demands have been previously rejected by Ukraine and the West.

        "description": "Children are like sponges; they\u2019re absorbing everything.",
        "content": "Talking about the distance between the UK and ongoing events can be helpful (Picture: Getty) As news of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine escalates, so do anxieties around the situation. Hundreds of Ukrainians are feared to have lost their lives, Boris Johnson has spoken of a \u2018tidal wave of violence\u2019 and Putin has warned other world leaders that they \u2018will face consequences greater than any in history\u2019 if they intevene. For those caught up in the violence and attacks, it\u2019s unimaginable \u2013 and for those looking on from afar, the feelings of fear and helplessness can be overwhelming. For children, who have less of an idea of what is going on, this can be even more terrifying. Hearing words like \u2018bombing\u2019, \u2018invasion\u2019 and \u2018World War Three\u2019 being thrown about, without a full understanding of what\u2019s going on, is worrisome for us all, and it doesn\u2019t\u2019 escape our little ones. \u2018Children are like sponges; they\u2019re absorbing everything,\u2019 explains multi-award-winning hypnotherapist, psychotherapist and mentor, Tania Taylor. \u2018Whether on the news, someone talking to the shop checkout lady, parents chatting in the playground, or the latest TikTok video, much of what they are hearing, especially once at school, is out of your control. \u2018And sometimes, external factors (for example, Kevin in the playground telling everyone that World War Three is starting and we\u2019re all going to die) can provoke more of a fear response.\u2019 It\u2019s very possible that even very young children are more aware of what war is than we might even realise. \u2018Many children have been exposed to adults or older siblings playing war-type computer games or watching YouTube influencers play such games on theirs or a friend\u2019s mobile phone or tablet,\u2019 Tania says. \u2018So,\u2019 she continues, \u2018words like \u201cbombing\u201d and \u201cinvasion\u201d may not be as unfamiliar to our children as we might assume.\u2019 Therefore, it\u2019s worth considering your language around younger children.\u00a0 But how is best to explain what\u2019s going on to the children in your life? And how can you go about reassuring any anxieties (while also managing your own)? How to approach the subject As parents and carers we can feel like what we should be doing is giving them all of the facts and keeping them informed. But this approach can sometimes leave children feeling overwhelmed, Tania explains. \u2018Children tend to be really good at spontaneous questioning. If they want to know something, they\u2019ll ask,\u2019 she says. But if they do ask, or you feel that they need some explanation or reassurance, it\u2019s important to think about how you\u2019re feeling first. Tania recommends: \u2018First of all, you need to consider your own state of mind in relation to what is going on and how much information you would personally like to give your child. \u2018This is important as even if you are led by your child\u2019s questioning, you begin with at least some self-awareness of how you are feeling and where you want to go with it.\u00a0 \u2018If you are particularly anxious about it all, it may be that you choose to wait until a time when you\u2019re feeling less anxious to talk about it. Or perhaps having a discussion with another important adult in your child\u2019s life, who can talk to your child instead, like a teacher or grandparent.\u2019\u00a0 Tania suggests that you may want to start with a non-specific question, like \u2018have you learned about wars at school?\u2019, and then listen to your child\u2019s response. \u2018What you\u2019re doing here is enabling your child an opportunity to talk about something which they may not realise they can talk about,\u2019 she notes. \u2018If your child isn\u2019t interested, they\u2019ll tell you so, and there\u2019s no need to push the conversation. If they go on to hear something at school, they\u2019ll know you know about it, and be more likely to approach you with any questions.\u2019 It\u2019s always a good idea to let children know that, if they have any questions, they can ask you. News like this can be scary to children if not handled in the right way, and it will be different for different ages (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) What can parents do and say to explain but not frighten? Talking about the distance between the UK and ongoing events can be helpful, suggests Tania. \u2018As much as we don\u2019t want to normalise war, it is something that has been happening at varying points across the globe for the whole of your child\u2019s life,\u2019 she explains. \u2018Knowing this can help to reassure your child that the chance they will be directly impacted is quite minimal. \u2018Although, they may want to talk to you about the people that are directly impacted. Keep language age appropriate and be led by your child. \u2018Taking action, such as getting in touch with a charity organisation that may accept shoebox-type gifts, is a really good way of showing your child that although this is happening far away, there are still small actions we can take to give our support.\u2019 Active listening Tania also recommends a technique called \u2018active listening\u2019, which you can use if your child is interested and wants to know more. \u2018What you are doing here is paying full attention to your child during the whole conversation, ignoring distractions, and putting all your focus on listening to your child\u2019s words,\u2019 she tells us. \u2018Listen to what they\u2019re asking, and don\u2019t give more information than they are asking for. We humans have a habit of oversharing, this is a situation when that\u2019s not necessarily helpful.\u2019 And if you don\u2019t know all the answers to their questions, don\u2019t be afraid to say you don\u2019t know. Tania adds: \u2018Perhaps you can spend time searching for information together, or maybe you feel more comfortable saying you\u2019ll find out and let them know later on.\u2019 How to talk to kids of different age groups News like this can be scary to children if not handled in the right way, and it will be different for different ages, explains Kirsty\u00a0Ketley \u2013 a qualified early years\u00a0and parenting consultant. \u2018There is no \u2018one way\u2019 approach, as all children are different, but it is important that the subject is treated with sensitivity and understanding of what children need to know, weighed against what they are hearing from other sources,\u2019 she tells us. \u2018Children of all ages will also feel more worried when they think that no one is willing to talk about things that are worrying to them \u2013 they will think that it is too scary or upsetting to talk about, which then adds to their worries.\u2019 Under seven \u2018I think it is unlikely for this age group to properly pick up on what is going on,\u2019 says Kirsty. \u2018But, if they do overhear your conversations or see the news and ask questions, it is important to make sure they know they are safe and that what is happening is not in our country \u2013 perhaps showing them on a map or globe, so they can grasp the distance. \u2018Kids of this age don\u2019t need to be burdened with news that they are unable to understand, so if they don\u2019t mention it, don\u2019t bring it up. Let them be blissfully unaware.\u2019 Jacqui O\u2019Connell is a\u00a0Youth Leader and Co-founder of the charity Spiritus, supporting homeschooled children in West London. She says: \u2018For younger children, we recommend reading a book about general worries and how to deal with them, such as Scared and Worried by psychiatrist James J Crist, PhD. You can then apply this to their worries about the situation with Ukraine and Russia. \u2018Age-appropriate books on worries can help us discuss concerns and support children without too much detail.\u2019 Tweens (between eight and 12) \u2018Tweens are at an impressionable age and are more aware of the world around them,\u2019 says Kirsty. \u2018They will have learned about war and conflict in history lessons at school, and so they will have preconceived ideas of what it is all about. She recommends watching something like Newsround, aimed towards 6-12 years olds, which explains things in an appropriate way. \u2018If you are worried how to go about things, watch it with your child and then have a discussion about what you have watched.\u2019 Another key to talking to children between the ages of 7-12 yrs is also how we question them. \u2018Keep it positive,\u2019 says\u00a0educational expert and founder of KidCoachApp Kavin Wadhar. \u2018Don\u2019t ask why they are worried. Children often struggle to understand their emotions, which can lead to further anxiety. Instead, ask them questions to help them work out solutions to their worries.\u2019 \u2018It is also crucial for parents to be aware of how they discuss the Ukraine and Russia situation with other adults around children or in earshot. \u2018Children are susceptible to how parents respond to issues, which can have a massive impact on a child\u2019s anxieties. Studies have shown that children from as young as one to two years old will mimic parents\u2019 behaviour.\u2019 Teens (12 and above) Kirsty suggests asking them what they already know and giving them lots of reassurance if they are worried. \u2018Let them know that you are there to talk through things,\u2019 she says. \u2018I think it is important that they know that what they are seeing on social media, won\u2019t all be accurate and suggest that they watch the news or read reliable news sources online, instead.\u2019 For teenagers, it is important to research the issues between Russia and Ukraine, look at the history of wars in Europe, and discuss why we have wars,\u2019 support worker and joint founder of Spiritus, Gemma Eni Cherish, says. \u2018We have had group discussions to give everyone a chance to share their point of view after exploring what is happening and why \u2013 \u00a0which helps ease their concerns. \u2018It also helps support children in finding their confidence as we suggest they develop ways to deal with anxieties. They build trust and confidence by sharing, and we all learn how to support each other.\u2019 What do the kids have to say? A straw poll of kids at homeschooling charity, Spiritus, gives an indication of the understanding kids of different ages have in relation to the Russia/Ukraine situation. 11-year-old: \u2018I don\u2019t want to know anything about it.\u2019 14-year-old: \u2018I am interested in the political side. if it got close to home I would want to know what was happening.\u2019 8-year-old boy: He says he only knows about World War I and II. He finds it very scary to think a war would ever happen again. 14-year-old Polish girl: \u2018Russia is our neighbour and has always wanted to be number one. They are greedy for land and if you are an enemy, they will try to destroy you.\u2019 12-year-old boy: \u2018This is scary for everyone. if you are not scared you should be.\u2019 14-year-old Syrian refugee student boy: \u2018I had to flee my country because of death and war. I felt safe in the U.K., but now with Russia going to war with Ukraine, I don\u2019t know where it is safe anymore. I feel scared for my family and me.\u2019 11-year-old girl: \u2018Russia has invaded Ukraine but Russia doesn\u2019t want Ukraine to join NATO since if they do, Ukraine will have help from the rest of Europe and the U.S. It makes me feel worried in case Russia invades the UK. Russia plans to destroy all of Ukraine\u2019s military bases.\u2019 13-year-old girl: \u2018It is not a laughing matter. I don\u2019t see why they need to invade a country when they have their own.\u2019 Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.

        "description": "Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.

        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout already reverberated around the world. In unleashing Moscow's most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, President Vladimir Putin deflected\u00a0global condemnation and cascading new sanctions\u00a0\u2014 and chillingly referred to his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. He threatened any foreign country attempting to interfere with \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Ukraine's president said Russian forces were trying to seize the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, and Ukrainian forces were battling other troops just miles from Kyiv for control of a strategic airport.\u00a0Large explosions were heard in the capital there and in other cities, and people massed in train stations and took to roads, as the government said the former Soviet republic was seeing\u00a0a long-anticipated invasion\u00a0from the east, north and south. The chief of the NATO alliance said the \u201cbrutal act of war\" shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders who decried the attack, which could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and upend the post-Cold War security order. The conflict was already shaking global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket. Condemnation rained down not only from the U.S. and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond \u2014 and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law. \u201cAs of today, our countries are on different sides of world history,\" Zelenskyy tweeted. \"Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won\u2019t give up its freedom.\u201d His adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said: \u201cA full-scale war in Europe has begun. ... Russia is not only attacking Ukraine, but the rules of normal life in the modern world.\u201d While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the U.S. and its NATO partners have so far\u00a0shown no indication they would join in a war against Russia. They instead mobilized troops and equipment around Ukraine\u2019s western flank \u2014 as Ukraine pleaded for defense assistance and help protecting its airspace. In Washington, President Joe Biden convened a meeting of the National Security Council on Thursday to discuss Ukraine as the U.S. prepares new sanctions. Biden administration officials have signaled that two of the measures they were considering most strongly include hitting Russia\u2019s biggest banks and slapping on new export controls meant to starve Russia\u2019s industries and military of U.S. semiconductors and other high-tech components. The attacks came first from the air. Later Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released footage showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine\u2019s government-held territory. European authorities declared the country\u2019s airspace an active conflict zone. In a worrying development, Zelenskyy said Russian forces were trying to seize the Chernobyl plant, and a Ukrainian official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Other governments did not immediately corroborate or confirm the claims. The plant was the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident when a nuclear reactor exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe. The plant lies 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital of Kyiv. After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin launched the operation on a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow's sway. The autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to shelter in place and not to panic despite the dire warnings. \u201cWe are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?\u201d 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to flee the city and try to eventually get to Poland to join her daughter. Putin \u201cwill be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.\u201d With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground. Ukraine\u2019s military chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said his troops were fighting Russian forces just 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the capital \u2014 in Hostomel, which is home to the Antonov aircraft maker and has a runway that is long enough to handle even the biggest cargo planes. Russian officials said separatist forces backed by Russia in the east have taken a new strip of territory from Ukrainian forces, but have not acknowledged ground troops elsewhere in the country. Associated Press reporters saw or confirmed explosions in the capital, in Mariupol on the Azov Sea, Kharkiv in the east and beyond. AP confirmed video showing Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukrainian-held territory in the north from Belarus and from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south. Russian and Ukrainian authorities made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones, and confirmed the loss of a Su-25 attack jet, blaming it on \u201cpilot error.\u201d It said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that \u201cthere is no threat to civilian population.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s armed forces They reported at least 40 soldiers dead, and said a military plane carrying 14 people crashed south of Kyiv. Poland\u2019s military increased its readiness level, and\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0and Moldova moved toward doing the same. Border crossings increased from Ukraine to Poland, which has prepared centers for refugees. Putin\u00a0justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. The\u00a0consequences of the conflict\u00a0and resulting sanctions on Russia reverberated throughout the world. World stock markets plunged and oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic surged toward or above $100 per barrel, on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. The ruble sank. Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle. In a reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, he warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d Among Putin\u2019s pledges was to \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler\u2019s forces. Kremlin propaganda paints members of Ukrainian right-wing groups as neo-Nazis, exploiting their admiration for WWII-era Ukrainian nationalist leaders who sided with the Nazis. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust and angrily dismissed the Russian claims. Putin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace. Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. The attack began even as the U.N. Security Council was meeting to hold off an invasion. Members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement of the operation\u00a0appealed to him to stand down. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the emergency meeting, telling Putin: \u201cGive peace a chance.\u201d But hours later, NATO\u2019s Jens Stoltenberg indicated it was too late: \u201cPeace on our continent has been shattered.\u201d",

According to Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his preparedness to engage in discussions with his Ukrainian counterpart, with a focus on obtaining\u00a0a guarantee of neutral status and the promise of no weapons on its territory. These are terms that, according to Peskov, would enable the achievement of the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, and eliminate what Russia currently views as a threat to the security of its state and people. \u201cThe president formulated his vision of what we would expect from Ukraine in order for the so-called \u2018red-line\u2019 problems to be resolved.

Our country woke up with the sounds of explosions and weapons fire, but is ready to defend its freedom and independence for it remains strong and ready for anything.\u201d The roughly 300-person studio based in Kyiv called on the gaming industry and others to support its nation\u2019s armed forces by donating to a special aid account. \u201cThrough pain, death, war, fear and inhuman cruelty, Ukraine will persevere.

Fuck the war, we do not condone it in any shape of form, fuck the ones who do and also Fuck the Fucking War.\u201d Ukraine is also home to a number of other game studios, both big and small. Crysis 4 maker Crytek has a subsidiary there, as does World of Tanks maker Wargaming. Assassin\u2019s Creed publisher Ubisoft also has two offices in Ukraine, one in Kyiv and one in Odessa, a major port city that was shutdown after being shelled by Russian forces last night. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any precautions it had taken, or if there are plans to have any personnel there evacuated. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); With some reports speculating that much of Ukraine could fall to Russian forces before the end of the day, it\u2019s unclear how many will manage to flee and what will happen to the rest. \u201cEveryone has been bracing for this yet there is still a massive sense of shock that it has come to this,\u201d a representative of Frogwares, developer of The Sinking City and the Sherlock Holmes series, told Kotaku in an email. \u201cWe have people all over Ukraine so a few woke today at 5:00 a.m. [local time] to the sound of shelling and rockets hitting nearby.

Work has slowed or stopped entirely within certain teams as individual employees set about doing what they need to do to ensure their safety first. Others logged in to at least have something to do / be able to talk to their colleagues and allow themselves some sort of distraction. There is of course a massive sense of frustration and anger too. Our country has been invaded for reasons beyond normal comprehension and under ridiculous pretenses. And so now everyone watches in horror as a situation that has been draining us for almost 8 years gets even worse. We're a peaceful nation, and in all the years since we gained our independence, we've never attacked or threatened anyone. Because of this situation, our work will be impacted and our lives can be destroyed. \u2014 Frogwares (@Frogwares) February 24, 2022 Russia\u2019s invasion follows years of conflict after 2014 protests led to the ousting of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an illegal coup, and responded by annexing Crimea. Metro series developer 4A Games announced it was relocating out of Ukraine to Malta following the violence at the time. Beatshapers studio director, Alexey Menshikov, told Axios last week that he and his roughly 30 employees planned for a \u201cworst case scenario\u2019 for relocation but were hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe situation reminds me of 2014 in general,\u201d lead designer at Red Beat,Yaroslav Singaevskiy, told Polygon earlier this week. \u201cThere are a lot of uncertainties, rumours, and fakes. [\u2026] The main difference is the state of the Ukrainian army that is much more capable, trained and prepared now thanks to eight years of an ongoing war. Support from the West \u2014 especially during the last several weeks \u2014 is crucial too.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what that support will ultimately be or what it could accomplish. President Biden and the EU announced a new round of more severe economic sanctions on Russia. In the meantime, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg condemned Russia\u2019s invasion as a \u201creckless and unprovoked attack.\u201d The post Ukraine Game Developers Respond To Russian Invasion appeared first on Kotaku Australia.",

        "content": "The mighty Russian military is likely to overpower Ukraine\u2019s (Picture: Reuters / Metro Graphics) Russia\u2019s army is among the biggest in the world and could overpower almost any other country on earth. But the Ukrainian military is not tiny and has been bolstered recently by additional support from Nato allies. Many inside Ukraine have also made it very clear that they are prepared to fight and have been seen training recently to prepare for combat. Russia\u2019s initial attacks have focused on destablising key military sites in Ukraine which has inflicted heavy damage. It is clear however that the decision to invade will very likely result in a bloody conflict, with significant loss of life on both sides. With the invasion under way, here we look at how the two countries\u2019 armies compare. Caption: Russian military strength versus Ukraine Metro Graphics Provider: Metro Graphics (Credits: via REUTERS) How big is the Ukrainian army? Ukraine has around 125,000 troops in its army plus a further 35,000 in its airforce and 15,000 in the navy. It also had 900,000 reservists at the last count, although it is not clear if this includes the many civilians who were being trained in combat in the weeks before the invasion. In terms of firepower, the country\u2019s military is thought to have more than 2,000 tanks and nearly 3,000 armoured vehicles. It has around 200 attack aircraft including helicopters and just two warships. Russia\u2019s army is one of the biggest in the world (Picture: Getty) How big is the Russian army? Russia has around double the number of troops in its army, with 280,000, but has many more in its airforce and navy; 280,000 and 150,000 respectively. Of these, it was thought there were around 190,000 troops massed on the border before the invasion began. It also has significantly more firepower; nearly 30,000 tanks and armoured vehicles, 1,300 attack aircraft, 74 warships and 50 submarines. As the country has had conscription since the end of the First World War \u2013 with all male citizens undergoing a year\u2019s service \u2013 there are many hundreds of thousands reservists on hand if needed. Russia is also the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power, with 6,257 warheads according to the latest estimates.

        "description": "\"We woke up at 4 am with a bang as we saw skies lit up followed by air sirens,\" said Pandita who studies at Taras Shevchenko National Medical University",
        "content": "Indian students woke up to air raid sirens and a suddenly well-lit sky and soon all hell broke loose on the streets of Kyiv, the capital of war-hit Ukraine, as some of them narrated their ordeal on Thursday, February 24, with frantic people rushing to petrol stations, banks and departmental stores in chock-a-block traffic. \"Tough times don't last but tough people do,\" Ashna Pandita, a third-year medical student, told PTI from her hostel in Kyiv over the phone. Students are not able to exchange their currency as Ukrainian stores have stopped trading dollars. The Indian mission in Kyiv was planning to relocate Indian nationals to the western border and has advised them to keep their passport and necessary documents with them all the time. \"We woke up at 4 am with a bang as we saw skies lit up followed by air sirens,\" said Pandita who studies at Taras Shevchenko National Medical University along with her twin brother Ansh. Besides Taras Shevchenko, two other universities \u2014 Bogomolets and UAFM \u2014 house a maximum number of Indian students in various streams. There was panic in the morning air as \"we saw military students studying with us packing their bags to join the forces and there was a clear instruction that no one will be making any video recordings of movement of troops,\" Pandita said. Bunkers in the hostel were opened and all students were directed to move there in case air sirens were sounded. The same drill has been started in all Metro stations. Aikin Ash Muthoo, also a third-year student from the same college hailing from Jamshedpur, says initially, he thought that an electric transformer had blown up but the confirmation of Russia carrying out an attack came from India. \"My parents called up and informed me that there was an attack, news enough to pull me out of the bed to understand the situation as we were preparing to leave for home and were awaiting our turn on Air India flights,\" Muthoo said. He said immediately the hostel staff started furnishing bunkers in the hostel so that people could be accommodated there in case of air raids by Russia. The hostel has around 40 Indians and the exact number of students was not available. \"We immediately rushed to the departmental store and carried back ration for two weeks and some water to survive for another week or so,\" Muthoo\u00a0said, adding the exchange of dollars had been stopped. All the students were keeping an eye on the advisories issued by the Indian mission in Ukraine with the latest being that all flights for evacuation had been closed and alternative arrangements were being finalised so that \"Indian nationals can be relocated to the western part of the country\". A fifth-year student at the same hostel, Shahshank Matta, who hails from Bengaluru and manages the Indian students, said, \"We are not sure about what is happening other than that we will be getting evacuated to the western part of the country.\"\u00a0 Akash Kaul, studying in the fifth year at Bogomolets Medical University, said that panic was high on the streets of Kyiv from the early hours of the morning. \"It took me nearly three hours to cover a distance which normally takes 15 minutes by cab,\" he said. \"I was awaken to the news by my father and immediately I rushed to my apartment to keep my passport and other documents ready,\" Kaul who was at his friend's place said. Kaul said while travelling, he saw several Ukrainian nationals carrying bags and suitcases who were moving out of Kyiv to safer places, \"probably to the western part of the country and seeking refuge in neighbouring Poland\". Kaul had to change his schedule after Air India announced that its evacuation flight had been cancelled due to the closure of air space over Ukraine. Accompanied by Sampath Ganesh, hailing from Tamil Nadu, Nitin Roy, hailing from Kerala but at present settled in Rajasthan, and Pranjal Singh from Jaunpur, Kaul, who is staying in a rented apartment in Vidrandnyi Ave in Kyiv, is keeping a close watch on the advisory issued by the Indian mission. \"I hope that something will be worked out soon,\" he added. Back in India, the father of Ashna and Ansh, Anil Pandita is anxious and constantly in touch with the children. \"They have limited stores and I hope things ease up soon,\" he said.\u00a0 The parent added that airlines escalated the ticket prices to an extent that it became virtually impossible for a middle-class family to afford it. \"I had booked them for March 6 but now I don't know whether they can make it,\" Anil Pandita said in a choked voice. Muthoo's father Aklesh said in a statement to PTI that they were worried as the children are short on cash as ATMs are not working and soon their supplies will come to an end. The parents made an appeal to the government to evacuate the Indian students from Ukraine at the earliest.",

        "description": "At dawn on Thursday, Ukrainians\u2019 uneasy efforts at normality were shattered. Smoke rose from cities, even well away from the country\u2019s disputed eastern border.",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The missile fragment pierced the ceiling of Mikhail Shcherbakov\u2019s apartment in Kharkiv. In an instant, Ukrainians found that war, after weeks of warnings, had hit home. \u201cI heard noise and woke up. I realized it sounded like artillery,\u201d Shcherbakov said. He jumped from the couch and ran to wake his mother, and something exploded behind him. The missile left a nearby computer and teacup shrouded with dust, instant artifacts of Europe\u2019s latest war. At dawn on Thursday, Ukrainians\u2019 uneasy efforts at normality were shattered. Smoke rose from cities, even well away from the country\u2019s disputed eastern border. A morning commute turned into lines of cars waiting at fuel stations or fleeing from the gray and drizzly capital, Kyiv. People with luggage took shelter in the subway, unsure of where to go. Some panicked immediately. Others clung to routine, with irritation. Voices from Ukraine: \u2018I need to now go and survive today\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m going to work. The only unusual thing is that you can\u2019t find a taxi in Kyiv,\u201d one resident complained, even as air raid sirens wailed. Many seemed unsure of know how to react. Kyiv\u2019s main street, Khreshchatyk, rippled with anxiety as people checked their phones. Some walked their dogs or waved at friends. \u201cI\u2019m not scared at the moment. Maybe I\u2019ll be scared later,\u201d resident Maxim Prudskoi said. The hotel where many Associated Press journalists stayed ordered an evacuation within 30 minutes. During the hurried checkout, the friendly desk clerk asked: \u201cDid you have anything from the mini-bar?\u201d In Mariupol, the Azov Sea port city that many fear will be the first major target because of its strategic importance, AP journalists saw similar confused scenes of routine and fear. Some residents waited at bus stops, seemingly on their way to work, while others rushed to leave the city that is only about 15 kilometers (less than 10 miles) from the front line with the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, one of two separatist-held areas recognized by Russian President Vladimir Putin as independent this week in a prelude to the invasion. Zelenskyy declares martial law, warns against panic As the day progressed, alarm across Ukraine rose. People crowded grocery stores and ATMs, seeking supplies and cash. In Kharkiv, worried residents inspected fragments of military equipment strewn across a children\u2019s playground. Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko called on the city\u2019s 3 million people to stay indoors unless they worked in critical sectors and said everyone should prepare go-bags with necessities such as medicine and documents. For weeks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had tried to moderate expectations of aggression by Russia, even as warnings by the United States became more urgent. Zelenskyy argued that panic would lead to societal destabilization that could be as much of a tactical advantage for Russia as the estimated 150,000 troops that had massed on Ukraine\u2019s borders. On Thursday, as the president imposed martial law, Ukrainians realized with a jolt that everything might change. \u201cI feel panic, scared and excited. I don\u2019t know who I should ask for help,\u201d said Kyiv resident Elizaveta Melnik.\u201d We didn\u2019t believe this situation would come.\u201d",

Russian state-owned Gazprom have been Schalke\u2019s main sponsor for the past 15 years, starting back in 2007, while the company is also one of UEFA\u2019s biggest sponsors with a deal worth a reported \u20ac40million (\u00a333.4m) per year. Schalke have come under pressure to end their relationship with the company following the situation in Ukraine and German newspaper Bild have already been covering up the logo with a \u2018Freedom for Ukraine\u2019 message. Bild swapped the Gazprom logo for a \u2018Freedom for Ukraine\u2019 message (Bild) Now the Bundesliga side, one of the most popular clubs in Germany, have removed the Gazprom logo from their shirts and are set to review their relationship with the Russian company. A statement on Thursday read: \u2018Following recent developments and escalation, FC Schalke 04 have decided to remove the logo of main sponsor Gazprom from the club\u2019s shirts. \u2018It will be replaced by lettering reading \u2018Schalke 04\u2019 instead.\u2019 The club added: \u2018The association will inform you about further possible steps in due course.\u2019 More: Champions League'It's not normal' - Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questions Chelsea transferThierry Henry explains why Christian Pulisic is not at Eden Hazard's level for ChelseaGlenn Hoddle and Eni Aluko disagree over Thomas Tuchel's decision to drop Romelu Lukaku The news comes after board member Matthias Warnig stepped down from his position, having been appointed as a representative of Gazprom on the club\u2019s supervisory board since July 2019. Ex-Stasi officer Warnig was also a managing director for Nord Stream 2 \u2013 which the German government has halted approval of \u2013 while German broadcaster Deutsche Welle claims he is the oldest German friend of Russian president Vladimir Putin. UEFA have called an emergency summit on Friday when they are expected to strip St Petersburg of this season\u2019s Champions League final, though many critics feel the governing body\u2019s relationship with Gazprom must also be addressed. Gazprom have become synonymous with UEFA competitions (Picture: Getty) A letter sent to UEFA from a group of politicians in the European parliament said: \u2018We call on you to stop considering St Petersburg and other Russian cities as venues for international football competitions and to choose as a first and very urgent step an alternative venue for the Champions League final on May 28, 2022. \u2018In addition, we appeal to you to convene a special meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee, to terminate cooperation with Gazprom as UEFA sponsor and to consider sanctions against individual Russian officials who are complicit in the violation of international law.\u2019 Gazprom ads were shown throughout BT Sport\u2019s coverage of the Champions League this week, with the broadcaster saying: \u2018As part of our UEFA contract we are obliged to show the UEFA Champions League bumpers, which are provided to us by UEFA to include in our broadcast.\u2019 MORE : UEFA to move Champions League final from St Petersburg after Russia invades Ukraine MORE : Manchester City footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko wishes \u2018painful death\u2019 on Vladimir Putin as UK stands on brink of war For more stories like this, check our sport page.

        "description": "Kyiv is an important cultural and industrial hub in Eastern Europe.",
        "content": "Kyiv is Ukraine\u2019s capital city. (Credits: Getty Images) The capital and most populous city of Ukraine, Kyiv, has a rich history, having seen the rise and fall of the Soviet Union before becoming an independent state. As tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate and Kyiv continues to make headlines, you might find yourself wondering when the city\u2019s name changed from Kiev to Kyiv. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Kyiv\u2019s origins and pronunciation. When did Kiev become Kyiv? Kyiv gets its name from one of its legendary founders, Kyi. According to a legend in an Old East Slavic chronicle, three brothers by the names of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv founded the medieval city of Kyiv. Before Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, it was a part of the Soviet Union, commonly known as the USSR. Ukraine prefers its capital to be called Kyiv, as Kiev is linked to its USSR past. (Credits: Getty Images) For centuries, English-speaking countries referred to Kyiv as Kiev, which is a spelling that\u2019s intrinsically linked with the old USSR days. Thus, countries across the globe have started to avoid using the name \u2018Kiev\u2019, especially the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict in 2014. Ukraine launched a #KyivNotKiev online campaign in 2018 to raise awareness. The campaign hoped to persuade English-language media and organizations to exclusively use Kyiv when referring to their city. It was a successful campaign, with multiple news outlets and organisations adopting Kyiv. How do you pronounce Kyiv? Kyiv is pronounced as KEE-ev, whereas the capital city\u2019s previous name Kiev was pronounced as Key-EV.

        "content": "U.S. markets pointed toward a sharply lower open, following a global plunge in stocks and a surge in oil prices Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched military action in Ukraine, prompting Washington and Europe to vow sanctions on Moscow that may roil the global economy. Oil prices jumped by more than $7 per barrel and futures for Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were off by more than 2.5 per cent. Market benchmarks in Europe and Asia fell as much as five per cent as traders tried to figure out how large Putin\u2019s incursion would be and the scale of Western retaliation. Energy prices surged, fuelling inflation fears. The spot price in Europe for natural gas, for which the continent relies on Russia to supply, jumped as much as 31 per cent. Brent crude oil jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 on unease about possible disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer. Benchmark U.S. crude was close behind at $99 per barrel. Prices of wheat and corn also jumped. The ruble sank as much as 7.5 per cent against the dollar overnight but recovered slightly, down about five per cent in the morning. Financial markets are in a \u201cflight to safety and may have to price in slower growth\u201d due to high energy costs, Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole of ING said in a report. Related: World expresses raw outrage, ponders Russia sanctions In Brussels, the president of the European Commission said Thursday the 27-nation European Union planned \u201cmassive and targeted sanctions\u201d on Russia. \u201cWe will hold President Putin accountable,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen said. The FTSE 100 in London fell 3.3 per cent after Europe awakened to news of explosions in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the major city of Kharkiv and other areas. The DAX in Frankfurt plunged 5.4 per cent and the CAC in Paris lost 4.9 per cent. Moscow\u2019s stock exchange briefly suspended trading on all its markets on Thursday morning. After trading resumed, the ruble-denominated MOEX stock index tumbled more than 20 per cent and the dollar-denominated RTS index plunged by more than a third. That was on top of Wednesday\u2019s 1.8 per cent slide for the S&P 500 to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked for military assistance. Moscow had sent soldiers to some rebel-held areas after recognizing them as independent. Some analysts expect the conflict to push investors out of many tech stocks, with the exception of the cybersecurity sector. \u201cGrowing concern that massive cyber warfare could be on the near-term horizon which would certainly catalyze an increase in spending around preventing sophisticated Russian-based cyber attacks,\u201d analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote in a note to clients. Putin said Russia had to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, a claim Washington had predicted he would make to justify an invasion. President Joe Biden denounced the attack as \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\u201d and said Moscow would be held accountable, which many took to mean Washington and its allies would impose additional sanctions. Putin accused them of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and to offer Moscow security guarantees. Washington, Britain, Japan and the EU earlier imposed sanctions on Russian banks, officials and business leaders. Additional options include barring Russia from the global system for bank transactions. The price for oil on international markets rose to $101.27, while West Texas Intermediate soared $7.65 to $99.75 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 25 cents to $92.10 on Wednesday. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 1.8 per cent to 25,970.82 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 3.2 per cent to 22,901.56. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.7 per cent to 3,429.96. Asian economies face lower risks than Europe does, but those that need imported oil might be hit by higher prices if Russian supplies are disrupted, forecasters say. The Kospi in Seoul lost 2.6 per cent to 2,648.80 and Sydney\u2019s S&P-ASX 200 fell three per cent to 6,990.60. India\u2019s Sensex fell 4.7 per cent to 54,529.91. New Zealand lost 3.3 per cent and Southeast Asian markets also fell. Investors already were uneasy about the possible impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to try to cool inflation by withdrawing ultra-low interest rates and other stimulus that boosted share prices. The dollar weakened to 114.69 yen from Wednesday\u2019s 114.98 yen. The euro fell to $1.1168 from $1.1306.",

        "content": "Russian military action against its neighbor is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the Turkish president says Turkey\u2019s President Recep Erdogan condemned Russia for its attack against Ukraine on Thursday. Ankara considers both Moscow and Kiev friends and \u201cfeels true regret\u201d over their military conflict, the Turkish leader said as quoted by the Anadolu news agency. Russia\u2019s operation \u201cviolates international law and poses a threat to regional stability,\u201d according to Erdogan. The Turkish leader chaired a National Security Council meeting after talking to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone on Thursday. Ankara called on Moscow to seek reconciliation with Kiev based on the 2015 Minsk agreement. The document, which Russia helped mediate, outlined a roadmap to peace between Kiev and the two Donbass regions which rebelled against the central Ukrainian government in 2014 after an armed coup in Kiev. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the agreements between Ukraine and its breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk were as good as dead because Kiev had refused to implement its part of the bargain for seven years. This was part of the justification for Russia\u2019s recognition of the rebellious regions as sovereign states. Thursday\u2019s attack was partially intended to protect the newly recognized Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics from continued harassment by Ukrainian forces, the Russian leader said on Monday morning, as he announced the Russian attack on Ukraine. Moscow seeks to dismantle the Ukrainian military and \u201cdenazify\u201d the nation, he stated. The Turkish leadership vowed on Thursday to continue supporting Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ankara said it would take action to ensure the safety of Turkish citizens in Ukraine, as well as Ukrainian Crimean Tatars, whom the Turks consider a brotherly people.",

In a statement made during a court hearing, the\u00a0long-time\u00a0protest leader said that the war would lead to a \u201chuge number of victims, ruined destinies, and a continuation of the impoverishment of Russian citizens.\" \u201cI am against this war,\u201d Navalny said. \u201cI believe that this war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the robbery of Russian citizens and divert their attention from the problems that exist inside the country, caused by the degradation of the economy.\u201d According to Navalny, the ongoing assault of Ukraine can be explained by looking at the corruption of Russian officials.

Navalny was jailed for two years and eight months after being found guilty of breaking the conditions of a suspended sentence he\u2019d received in 2014, after being found guilty of embezzling 30 million rubles ($415,000) from two companies, including the French cosmetics brand Yves Rocher. He currently stands accused of fraud and contempt of court. Early on Thursday morning, in a televised address to the nation, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would begin launching a so-called \u201cspecial military operation\" in Ukraine. The president also called for the complete \u201cdemilitarization\u201d and \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine, and made a pledge to prosecute those who were involved in \u201cnumerous bloody crimes against civilians,\u201d He told Ukrainian soldiers \u201cto put down arms immediately\u201d so that they can return back home to their families.

The final is scheduled to take place in St Petersburg\u2019s 68,000-capacity Gazprom Arena on May 28 but Russia\u2019s attack looks likely to force a change of venue.

West Ham\u2019s London stadium could also come into consideration as a potential alternative venue for the Champions League final (Picture: Getty) If another all-English final was to occur, like last year\u2019s between Chelsea and Manchester City, there would be pressure to host it in the UK but two major stadiums are already out of bounds.

        "content": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 The websites of Ukraine's defense, foreign and interior ministries were unreachable or painfully slow to load Thursday morning after a punishing wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks as Russia struck at its neighbor, explosions shaking the capital of Kyiv and other major cities. In addition to DDoS attacks on Wednesday, cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware, some in neighboring Latvia and Lithuania. Asked if the denial-of-service attacks were continuing Thursday morning, senior Ukrainian cyber defense official Victor Zhora did not answer. \u201cAre you serious?\" he texted. \"There are ballistic missiles here.\u201d \"This is terrible. We need the world to stop it. Immediately,\u201d Zhora said of the offensive that Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in the pre-dawn hours. Officials have long expected cyberattacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion. The combination of DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with junk traffic to render them unreachable, and malware infections hewed to Russia's playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression. ESET Research Labs\u00a0said it detected a previously unseen piece of data-wiping malware Wednesday on \u201chundreds of machines in the country.\u201d It was not clear how many networks were affected. \u201cWith regards whether the malware was successful in its wiping capability, we assume that this indeed was the case and affected machines were wiped,\u201d said ESET research chief Jean-Ian Boutin. He would not name the targets but said they were \u201clarge organizations.\u201d ESET was unable to say who was responsible. Symantec Threat Intelligence\u00a0detected three organizations hit by the wiper malware \u2014 Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine, said Vikram Thakur, its technical director. Both countries are NATO members. \u201cThe attackers have gone after these targets without much caring for where they may be physically located,\u201d he said. All three had \u201cclose affiliation with the government of Ukraine,\u201d said Thakur, saying Symantec believed the attacks were \u201chighly targeted.\u201d He said roughly 50 computers at the financial outfit were impacted, some with data wiped. Asked about the wiper attack on Wednesday, Zhora had no comment. Boutin said the malware\u2019s timestamp indicated it was created in late December. \u201cRussia likely has been planning this for months, so it is hard to say how many organizations or agencies have been backdoored in preparation for these attacks,\u201d said Chester Wisniewski,\u00a0principal research scientist at the cybersecurity firm Sophos.\u00a0He guessed the Kremlin intended with the malware to \u201csend the message that they have compromised a significant amount of Ukrainian infrastructure and these are just little morsels to show how ubiquitous their penetration is.\u201d Word of the wiper follows a mid-January attack that Ukrainian officials blamed on Russia in which the defacement of some 70 government websites was used to mask intrusions into government networks in which at least two servers were damaged with wiper malware masquerading as ransomware. Cyberattacks have been a key tool of Russian aggression in Ukraine since before 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Crimea and hackers tried to thwart elections. They were also used against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. Their intent can be to sow panic, confuse and distract. Distributed-denial-of-service attacks are among the least impactful because they don\u2019t entail network intrusion. Such attacks barrage websites with junk traffic so they become unreachable. The DDoS targets Wednesday included the defense and foreign ministries, the Council of Ministers and Privatbank, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank. Many of the same sites were similarly knocked offline Feb. 13-14 in DDoS attacks that the U.S. and U.K. governments quickly blamed on Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency Wednesday\u2019s DDoS attacks appeared less impactful than the earlier onslaught \u2014 with targeted sites soon reachable again \u2014 as emergency responders blunted them. Zhora\u2019s office, Ukraine\u2019s information protection agency, said responders switched to a different DDoS protection service provider. Russia-Ukraine: What to know as Russia attacks Ukraine Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the network management firm Kentik Inc.,\u00a0recorded two attack waves\u00a0each lasting more than an hour. A spokesman for California-based Cloudflare, which provides services to some of the targeted sites, said Wednesday that DDoS attacks in Ukraine had been until then sporadic but on the rise in the past month but \u201crelatively modest compared to large DDoS attacks we\u2019ve handled in the past.\u201d The West blames Russia\u2019s GRU for some of the most damaging cyberattacks on record, including a pair in 2015 and 2016 that briefly knocked out parts of Ukraine\u2019s power grid and the NotPetya \u201cwiper\u201d virus of 2017, which caused more than $10 billion of damage globally by infecting companies that do business in Ukraine with malware seeded through a tax preparation software update. The wiper malware detected in Ukraine this year has so far been manually activated, as opposed to a worm like NotPetya, which can spread out of control across borders.",

Leading outcry in Ukraine, former boxer Wladimir wrote in a tweet on Wednesday: \u2018The world is watching how reckless and deadly imperialism is, not just for #Ukraine but the whole world. Let history be a lesson to not be repeated.\u2019 The 45-year-old former heavyweight champion also joined his older brother Vitali Klitschko, who is Mayor of Kyiv, in a video message calling for the world to stand with Ukraine.\u00a0 With Wladimir beside him, Mayor Vitali said: \u2018I\u2019m calling to all international partners to observe this tragedy that is happening nowadays in Ukraine and this senseless war which is not going to have any winners or losers. I just want to tell you we must stay united against this aggression, this Russian aggression. \u2018Don\u2019t let it continue happening in Ukraine, don\u2019t let it happen in Europe and eventually in the world.\u2019\u00a0 Wladimir Klitschko called for the world to stand with Ukraine (Picture: AFP via Getty Images) The former boxer led reactions from Ukrainian celebrities to the invasion (Picture: @klitschko, Twitter) \u2018United we\u2019re strong.

Troops and tanks have entered the Vilcha crossing, which lies less than a 100 miles north of the capital on a road which runs directly to the city.

        "content": "Kiev tells Ankara to close two straits that Moscow relies on Ukraine has asked Turkey to cut off Russian access to the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits after Moscow launched an attack\u00a0on multiple Ukrainian cities in the early hours of Thursday morning. Kiev\u2019s demand to suspend Russian ships\u2019 access through the straits was conveyed by Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, who also lobbied for the closure of Turkey\u2019s airspace to Russian planes, news agency Reuters reported. The move comes in response to Russian air and ground attacks launched on Ukrainian military installations, airports, and cities, including the capital, Kiev, throughout the course of Thursday. The offensive was dubbed a \u2018special military operation\u2019 by President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe are calling for the air space, [and the] Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to be closed. We have conveyed our relevant demand to the Turkish side. At the same time, we want sanctions imposed on the Russian side,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar told a news conference in Ankara. Read more Russia closes airspace as Moscow confirms strikes against Ukraine The Dardanelles Strait provides access from the Aegean Sea into the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus Strait, along which Istanbul is built, links the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea. Discontinued use of this route would essentially disconnect Russia\u2019s south-westerly ports on the north coast of the Black Sea from Europe. Under a 1936 pact, Ankara has control over the straits and may limit warship passages during wartime or if threatened. Ukraine\u2019s request could cause complications for Turkey, a nation which, despite its membership of western military bloc NATO, also shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, and has good relations with both countries. Turkey has opposed sanctions on Moscow, while other NATO members have pushed for anti-Russia measures to be implemented, targeted predominantly at crippling the country\u2019s economy. President Tayyip Erdogan, while he has condemned Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, stressed that his government would strive to maintain ties with both Russia and Ukraine, while still taking the correct steps in the management of the crisis.",

        "content": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Stocks plunged and oil prices surged by more than $5 per barrel Thursday after President Vladimir Putin launched military action in Ukraine, prompting Washington and Europe to vow sanctions on Moscow that may roil the global economy. Market benchmarks in Europe and Asia fell by as much as 4% as traders tried to figure out how large Putin's incursion would be and the scale of Western retaliation. Wall Street futures retreated by an unusually wide daily margin of 2.5%. OKC highways partially clear, but most remain slick and hazardous Brent crude oil briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 on unease about possible disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer. Benchmark U.S. crude briefly surpassed $98 per barrel. Prices of wheat and corn also jumped. The ruble sank 7.5% against the dollar. Financial markets are in a \u201cflight to safety and may have to price in slower growth\" due to high energy costs, Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole of ING said in a report. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission said Thursday the 27-nation European Union planned \u201cmassive and targeted sanctions\u201d on Russia. At least 40 killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine \u201cWe will hold President Putin accountable,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen said. In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London fell 2.5% to 7,311.69 as Europe awakened to news of explosions in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the major city of Kharkiv and other areas. The DAX in Frankfurt plunged 4% to 14,047.18 and the CAC in Paris lost 3.6% to 6,537.32 The futures for Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were off 2%. That was on top of Wednesday's 1.8% slide for the S&P 500 to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked for military assistance. Moscow had sent soldiers to some rebel-held areas after recognizing them as independent. Putin said Russia had to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, a claim Washington had predicted he would make to justify an invasion. President Joe Biden denounced the attack as \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\" and said Moscow would be held accountable, which many took to mean Washington and its allies would impose additional sanctions. Putin accused them of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and to offer Moscow security guarantees. Research at the Oklahoma City Metro Library reveals an uncomfortable past, but a healing response Washington, Britain, Japan and the EU earlier imposed sanctions on Russian banks, officials and business leaders. Additional options include barring Russia from the global system for bank transactions. Prices of benchmark U.S. and international oils hovered near $100 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate soared $5.86 to $97.96 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 25 cents to $92.10 on Wednesday. Brent crude advanced $5.57 to $99.62 per barrel in London after spiking above $100. It lost 20 cents to $94.05 the previous session. Russia attacks Ukraine as defiant Putin warns US, NATO In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 1.8% to 25,970.82 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 3.2% to 22,901.56. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.7% to 3,429.96. Asian economies face lower risks than Europe does, but those that need imported oil might be hit by higher prices if Russian supplies are disrupted, forecasters say. The Kospi in Seoul lost 2.6% to 2,648.80 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 fell 3% to 6,990.60. India's Sensex fell 3.4% to 55,283.65. New Zealand lost 3.3% and Southeast Asian markets also fell. Investors already were uneasy about the possible impact of the Federal Reserve's plans to try to cool inflation by withdrawing ultra-low interest rates and other stimulus that boosted share prices. The dollar weakened to 114.68 yen from Wednesday's 114.98 yen. The euro fell to $1.1243 from $1.1306.",

Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and natural gas. The conflict in Ukraine could in turn disrupt the flow of oil and send U.S. gas prices in a climb. Experts predicted a rise in prices at the pump as much as 30 cents per gallon. Vladimir Putin announces Ukraine military operation, explosions heard Sanctions and counter-sanctions could also push those prices to all-time highs. Consumers could also end up paying more for essentials at the grocery store, especially for wheat and grain. Russia and Ukraine together produce more than 25% of the world's wheat exports, and nearly 20% of corn exports. The crisis is also expected to draw wild swings in the markets as global investors worry over the developing conflict. Earlier this week, President Joe Biden addressed the ongoing conflict promising to minimize the impacts in the U.S. \"I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours,\" President Biden said. \"We're closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We're executing a plan in coordination with major oil producing consumers and producers.\" Experts said they hope the impacts are short-term but said it depends on a lot of unknowns as the conflict goes on.",

The operation \u201chas its goals and they need to be achieved,\u201d the official said, when asked by journalists when the offensive would end. In his Thursday morning address, Putin said he\u2019d ordered Russian troops to attack Ukraine to demilitarize and, as he put it,\u00a0\u201cdenazify\u201d the country. He claimed Russia\u2019s national security was compromised by NATO encroachment in Ukraine. He further stated that Russia was duty-bound to protect the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk from continued attacks by the Ukrainian forces. Moscow recognized the two entities as sovereign states on Monday. Read more China comments on Russian operation in Ukraine Russia is determined to \u201cneutralize the [Ukrainian] military potential, which was boosted considerably lately, including with the active assistance of foreign nations,\u201d Peskov said. He added that\u00a0\u201cideally\u201d Ukraine needs to be \u201ccleansed\u201d from neo-Nazi ideology. Peskov rejected the idea that Russia was in the process of occupying Ukraine, saying the Russian invasion had limited goals of protecting Russia and the separatist regions. He said the future of Ukraine will be determined by the Ukrainian people. The Russian military launched a massive attack against Ukraine on Putin\u2019s order right after his televised address. The defense ministry said it was targeting elements of the Ukrainian military infrastructure and sought to avoid civilian casualties. Multiple reports from the ground said apparent Russian strikes throughout Ukraine have caused damage to military bases, weapons depots and some arms factories.",

Ukraine's leadership said at least 40 people have been killed and dozens are wounded so far in what it called a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d targeting the country from the east, north and south.

Five people have died. World leaders\u00a0have decried the attack, which could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government, upend the post-Cold War security order and result in severe economic impact around the world from soaring heating bills to spikes in food prices.

President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy. The president plans to address the country later Thursday. Zelenskyy in an announcement called the incursion \"an unjustified deceitful and cynical invasion\" and declared martial law. He later asked via Twitter to \"close airspace,\" which NewsNation's Leland Vittert interpreted as asking the West to impose a no-fly zone. \"Ukrainians will never give up their freedom and independence to anyone,\" Zelenskyy stated. \"Only we, all citizens of Ukraine, have been determining our future since 1991. But now the fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what life in Europe will be like.\" The outlook for Ukraine is bleak. Retired Lt. Gen. Richard Newton said the Ukrainian forces are \u201cnot a match\u201d for the Russia army.\u00a0Newton, speaking on a special edition of \"NewsNation Prime,\" predicted Ukraine could fall to the Russian military in about four days, and thought Russia could have air superiority in the country within a matter of hours. In the early-morning hours of Thursday in Ukraine, smoke could be seen rising from the capital, and later on air-raid sirens rang through the city, which turned out to be a drill. Some journalists donned flak jackets and helmets as they delivered live reports. Questions about Russia-Ukraine conflict? Let us know and we\u2019ll try to get answers Russia has launched attacks in 10 Ukrainian regions, primarily in the east and south of the country, Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service stated.

The Russian Defense Ministry statement said the military is using precision weapons to target Ukrainian air bases, air defense assets and other military infrastructure. It claimed that \u201cthere is no threat to civilian population.\u201d Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military has launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro. After the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. But then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to be starting in relative calm. Russia\u2019s Putin announces military operation in Ukraine, explosions heard Beyond casualties that could overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s government, the consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent. Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged after the military action got underway. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, \u201cwhoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.\u201d Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d In a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, Putin warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d He emphasized that Russia is \u201cone of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.\u201d Research at the Oklahoma City Metro Library reveals an uncomfortable past, but a healing response Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia. Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that the White House said was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion. Putin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said. He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: \u201cStop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.\u201d Remains of Oklahoma man missing since 2012 discovered NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement saying he strongly condemns \u201cRussia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.\u201d Anxiety about an imminent Russian offensive soared after Putin recognized the separatist regions\u2019 independence on Monday, endorsed the deployment of troops to the rebel territories and received parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country. The West responded with sanctions. Late Wednesday, Ukrainian lawmakers approved a decree that imposes a nationwide state of emergency for 30 days starting Thursday. The measure allows authorities to declare curfews and other restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations \u201cin the interests of national security and public order.\u201d The action reflected increasing concern among Ukrainian authorities after weeks of trying to project calm. The Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended that any Ukrainians who are there leave immediately. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday the Russian force of more than 150,000 troops arrayed along Ukraine\u2019s borders is in an advanced state of readiness. \u201cThey are ready to go right now,\u201d Kirby said. Early Thursday, airspace over all of Ukraine was shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice to airmen. A commercial flight tracking website showed that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine was a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane, which began flying westward early Thursday after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory. Family claims there\u2019s proof victim of former Oklahoma City officer Daniel Holtzclaw recanted Another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks hit Ukraine\u2019s parliament and other government and banking websites on Wednesday, and cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had also infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware. Officials have long said they expect cyberattacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion, and analysts said the incidents hew to a nearly two-decade-old Russian playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression. Even before Putin\u2019s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets. Biden allowed sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company\u2019s CEO. Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Putin had launched \u201cthe beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d by sending troops into the separatist regions. The pipeline is complete but has not yet begun operating. Even before the Russian military attack on Ukraine began, the threat of war had\u00a0shredded Ukraine\u2019s economy\u00a0and raised the specter of massive casualties,\u00a0energy shortages across Europe\u00a0and global economic chaos. European Union sanctions\u00a0against Russia took effect, targeting several companies along with 351 Russian lawmakers who voted for a motion urging Putin to recognize the rebel regions and 27 senior government officials, business executives and top military officers. The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d ___ Karmanau and Heintz reported from Kyiv.

These (sanctions) have been closely coordinated with our allies and partners, and we'll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates,\" he added.Also read: Russia-Ukraine Crisis: Ukraine's Ambassador to India Urges PM Modi to Contact PutinAlso watch:",

The attack reportedly injured one person and caused a fire on board one of the ships. The border guard division of the FSB\u2019s Krasnodar branch identified the ships as oiler \u2018SGV-Flot\u2019 and general cargo ship \u2018Seraphim Sarovskiy\u2019.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the operation was necessary to demilitarize and \u201cdenazify\u201d the country. He claimed Russia had to act due to a growing threat to its national security posed by NATO\u2019s presence in Ukraine, and to stop attacks by Ukrainian troops against the separatist regions in the east, which Moscow recognized as sovereign states on Monday.",

While Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference that \u2018Peace on our continent has been shattered\u2019 Eurovision Song Contest organisers described the competition as a \u2018non-political cultural event\u2019. They also appeared to dismiss suggestions Russia\u2019s attack on its neighbour would result in the country being banned for 2022. The 66th edition of the annual competition is due to take in Turin after Italian rock band Maneskin triumphed during the 2021 contest. It comes as the European Union and others condemned the Russian invasion and promised tough sanctions to hit the Kremlin. A statement from the contest, which is produced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said (via PA News Agency): \u2018The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political cultural event which unites nations and celebrates diversity through music. M\u00e5neskin won last year\u2019s contest (Picture: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images) \u2018The EBU\u2019s public broadcaster members in both Russia and Ukraine have committed to participating in this year\u2019s event in Turin and we are currently planning to welcome artists from both countries to perform in May. \u2018We of course will continue to monitor the situation closely.\u2019 Last week, the act chosen to represent Ukraine in Turin, Alina Pash, withdrew from representing her country after facing scrutiny over a reported 2015 visit to Russia-occupied Crimea. Pash had been chosen in a televised national selection show and was due to perform her song Shadows Of Forgotten Ancestors, but pulled out after details of the trip emerged. Ukrainian military vehicles move past Independence square in central Kyiv today (Picture: AFP via Getty Images Source: AFP People who enter the territory via Russia are considered by Ukraine to have illegally crossed the border. There is no suggestion Pash entered Crimea from Russia. She was replaced by rap group Kalush Orchestra with the song Stefania. Russia has not yet announced its act. Eurovision has often reflected geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine has played out at the event in previous years. In 2017, Julia Samoylova was chosen to represent Russia in the annual singing competition, which took place in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

        "content": "Daylight has revealed the initial aftermath of Russia\u2019s overnight bombing raids on Ukraine (Picture: Getty Images / Reuters) Ukrainians woke up to the news their country was being invaded by Russia this morning after Vladimir Putin gave the order for an assault to begin. Key targets across the country have been hit by missile strikes, with large explosions heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Air raid sirens have sounded across the country \u2013 including in the capital of Kyiv, where traffic jams have formed on routes out of the city as people attempt to flee. Ukraine\u2019s border guard said it was under attack \u2018with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and firearms\u2019 in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr. President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro. The Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine\u2019s air defences and air bases within hours of the invasion beginning, while Ukraine claimed to have shot down Russian aircraft. Neither claim could be immediately verified. One airstrike hit an apartment building in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast (Picture: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) A wounded man is helped from an apartment block in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast, which was hit by a Russian airstrike (Picture: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The Russian Defence Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that \u2018there is no threat to civilian population\u2019. The strikes took place under the cover of the darkness, while many Ukrainians were still asleep. Now, in the light of day, the damage done by the initial blasts has been revealed with images of targets showing collapsed buildings, twisted metal and debris. Where an apartment block was hit, firefighters could be seen trying to put out flames while people were helped from the collapsed building. Ukrainians who have long braced for the prospect of an attack, while never knowing precisely when it would come, have been urged not to panic. In Kyiv, mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay at home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare \u2018go-bags\u2019 with necessities and documents in case they need to evacuate. Some have already started to leave.

What could be worse?\u2019 Liudmila Gireyeva from Kyiv said. The 64-year-old said she planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. The consequences of the conflict could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies and pushing up household bills in the UK. Nato secretary-general Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement today condemning \u2018Russia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives\u2019. \u2018Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country,\u2019 he added.

The 59-year-old journalist and co-host Naga Munchetty, 46, presented Thursday\u2019s edition of the morning show to discuss the latest news surrounding the Ukraine crisis. In light of\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion, President Vladimir Putin\u00a0launched military action in Ukraine in the early hours,\u00a0saying the move was a response to threats from the country. Mr Tugendhat appeared on the programme via video call talking about the \u2018first invasion of a European country since 1989,\u2019 however, things took an unexpected turn when his daughter tapped him from the side. The MP motioned a shushing gesture to his little one in the hopes of her settling, which led Stayt to ask if he was \u2018ok\u2019. \u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve got an interruption there,\u2019 he added. Oh the joys of working from home (Picture: BBC) \u2018Are you ok to carry on,\u2019 said Charlie Stayt \u2018I am, yes,\u2019 Mr Tugendhat replied. The adorable moment didn\u2019t go unnoticed by viewers on social media, with one person writing: \u2018Something rather poignant about @TomTugendhat\u2019s #BBCBreakfast interview on Ukraine being interrupted by his daughter as he talks about the tragedy of families fleeing the places they love.\u2019 While another added: \u2018@TomTugendhat showed nothing but a smile and a loving look to his interrupting daughter who was blissfully unaware he was live on telly @BBCBreakfast. \u2018Can\u2019t imagine a Russian politician surviving the same experience.

Mr Putin issued a stark warning to other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u2018consequences they have never seen\u2019.

Wes Gleeson, speaking while wrapped up against the biting cold, said he was woken in the night by his mother-in-law saying, \u2018Putin\u2019s attacked\u2019. The software entrepreneur, originally from Oxford, ignored British government advice to leave the country, choosing to remain with his Ukrainian wife and her family. He spoke on a fading phone battery with a long queue of people visible over his shoulder in the line at the ATM. The couple evacuated their flat on a route into the centre of the capital and, taking their cat, moved in with her parents, where they hope will be out of the line of fire on the outskirts of the city. Mr Gleeson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I was woken in the middle of the night by my mother-in-law saying basically in Russian, \u201cPutin\u2019s attacked\u201d and I immediately jumped on the news and told my mother back home. I can\u2019t stay on this for very long because I have to conserve the phone battery. \u2018I\u2019ve been stood in a cashpoint queue for over two hours just to get out whatever I can. It looks like the cashpoint\u2019s giving out money but it\u2019s doing it very slowly and it\u2019s pretty bitterly cold.

Some Ukrainian territory and border points have already fallen to Russian forces, according to reports. Mr Gleeson, 43, said: \u2018We\u2019re shocked, we\u2019re all discussing what we\u2019re going to do, we vaguely had a plan but we didn\u2019t expect it to happen this quickly, we thought we would have more of a heads up. We haven\u2019t decided yet, I think it\u2019s going to be a family vote. \u2018We just heard a few planes go overhead, probably you can\u2019t see them because it\u2019s overcast.

He spoke as witnesses told of troops pouring into eastern cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol. A second wave of missile strikes is currently underway, according to the Reuters news agency. Speaking from an undisclosed location, the president of Ukraine declared martial law and vowed the army would resist. Mr Putin accompanied the beginning of the invasion with a warning to the world not to intervene. He said: \u2018Whoever tries to interfere with us and even more so to create threats for our country, now people should know Russia\u2019s response will be immediate and lead to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history.\u2019 The Russian President said his goal was the \u2018demilitarisation and denazification\u2019 of Ukraine and it should be \u2018liberated and cleared\u2019. Boris Johnson has described the attack as \u2018a catastrophe for our continent\u2019 ahead of an emergency statement in the Commons later today. The West is readying itself to mount a response to\u00a0Russia\u2019s attack overnight, with a raft of new sanctions expected to be imposed today. Do you have a story you would like to share?

        "content": "Kyiv is being hit by fresh missile strikes (Picture: @KievUkraineLive) Ukraine is being hit by a second wave of missile strikes from Russia following a heavy bombing campaign this morning. Footage on social media appears to show another round of explosions hitting Kyiv. Troops are now said to be closing in on the capital city, with reports they have breached a border less than 100 miles away. It comes after Vladimir Putin finally gave the order for his long-anticipated invasion to begin. Ukraine is now under heavy attack with hundreds of civilians already feared dead. Authorities said the first wave hit military command centres and other key buildings in several cities. An adviser to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a briefing that a second wave of strikes has now begun. Mr Zelenskyy has vowed to \u2018fight for our country\u2019 but urged global leaders to help by providing more defence assistance. The military has long been preparing for an assault from Russia with the help of Western allies, but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations. Nato has agreed to increase land, sea, and air forces on eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia. The EU, UK and US are all discussing a package of sanctions against Putin with announcements expected later today. Zelensky has called for people with military experience to \u2018join the defence of Ukraine\u2019 and asked for blood donations to help wounded soldiers. He said: \u2018Everyone who has military experience who can join the defence of Ukraine has to come to the military offices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. \u2018Please keep yourself updated on the information. We have wounded soldiers in hospitals that require blood donations, please join and donate your blood. \u2018We carry out serious work on the defence and every enterprise, every business person needs to help. Please look after your workers, your employees. \u2018All people should have all the necessary facilities and goods. The bank system of Ukraine has got the resources to protect this state, to protect the interests of Ukrainian nationals. \u2018I\u2019m grateful to all the politicians who support Ukraine and defend our sovereignty.\u2019 Targets across Ukraine have been hit by rocket strikes and there are reports some areas and border points have already fallen to Russian forces. There has reportedly been heavy bombing in Odessa, the seat of Ukraine\u2019s navy, which is feared to have been crippled already, although reports differ. Troops are flooding into eastern cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol, witnesses have said. Air raid sirens have sounded across the country \u2013 including in Lviv, where most diplomatic missions have moved to \u2013 and communication systems have been hit by cyberattacks. Ukraine\u2019s border guards said it was under attack \u2018with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and firearms\u2019 in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr. It said Belarus\u2019 armed forces \u2013 a Russian ally which lies to Ukraine\u2019s north close to Kyiv \u2013 had joined in with the military assault, with at least one border point destroyed. Videos posted on social media showed smoke rising above several Ukrainian cities and there are unconfirmed reports Russian paratroopers have moved to take control of Kyiv airport. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence claimed to have \u2018disabled\u2019 Ukraine\u2019s air force and \u2018incapacitated\u2019 military infrastructure, according to state media. Despite coming under heavy attack, officials in Ukraine have sought to project a confident front. Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said it had shot down five Russian planes and a helicopter in its airspace. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the military is \u2018fighting hard\u2019 and \u2018inflicting significant losses to the enemy\u2019. He said that Ukraine\u00a0\u2018now needs a greater and very specific support from the world \u2013 military-technical, financial as well as tough sanctions against Russia\u2019. Another adviser, Oleksii Arestovich said the Russian strike has not achieved its goal to rout the country\u2019s military.

        "content": "Major crude benchmarks hit their highest price levels since 2014 Oil prices surged on Thursday, with the major global crude benchmark, Brent, breaching $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, amid concerns that the escalating crisis between Russia and Ukraine over the Donbass regions could disrupt global energy supplies. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation, aimed at \u201cthe defense\u201d of the newly recognized republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The first Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian military positions have been confirmed by Moscow. The Brent crude price has since jumped to over $105 a barrel \u2013 the highest in over seven years. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soared over 8% to as much as $100 a barrel \u2013 the highest since 2014. Oil prices have risen over $20 a barrel since the start of the year, amid fears that the United States and Europe would impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector, disrupting supplies. \u201cThis growing uncertainty during a time when the oil market is already tight does leave it vulnerable, and so prices are likely to remain volatile and elevated,\u201d the head of ING\u2019s commodity research, Warren Patterson told Reuters. READ MORE: Putin announces 'special operation' in Donbass Analysts have raised concerns that the situation could worsen if the West places sanctions on the energy trade. Russia is the world\u2019s second-largest crude oil producer and exporter. \u201cIt\u2019s not just geopolitical risk that is the problem, but the further straining of supply,\u201d OCBC Bank economist Howie Lee has been quoted as saying by a number of media outlets. \u201cRussian oil supply will disappear overnight if faced with sanctions ... and OPEC can\u2019t produce fast enough to cover this gaping hole,\u201d he added.

        "description": "Commercial airlines have grounded flights to the under siege country having received 'do not fly' notices.",
        "content": "Skies above Ukraine and parts of Russia were empty of commercial air traffic as the invasion began (Picture: PA) Flights above Ukraine were cancelled as the Russian invasion began, with many neighbouring countries also closing their airspace. Commercial planes were grounded as Vladimir Putin began his missile assault in the early hours of the morning, leaving airports in the country abandoned. Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure ministry announced all air traffic was being halted shortly after midnight. An El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto made a sudden U-turn out of Ukraine\u2019s airspace around the time of its closure, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed. A LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv also turned back to Warsaw around the same time. Neighbouring Moldova is diverting flights to airports elsewhere while Russia\u2019s close ally Belarus also closed part of its airspace. Flight maps appeared to show planes avoiding large parts of Russia itself with traffic concentrating on flying over eastern Europe and Turkey. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency urgently told air operators of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine as it is now \u2018an active conflict zone.\u2019 People abandoned trollies at Kyiv airport as all flights were grounded (Picture: Reuters) Those trying to flee Ukraine have turned to the roads and rail network instead (Picture: Reuters) Some abandoned their luggage as hopes of being able to board a flight were dashed (Picture: Reuters) It also warned airspace in Russia and Belarus within 100 nautical miles of their borders with Ukraine could pose safety risks. \u2018In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,\u2019 the agency said in a conflict zone bulletin. \u2018The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.\u2019 In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority confirmed it had instructed airlines to avoid Ukrainian airspace until further notice. Russian passports have been burnt by demonstrators (Picture: AP) Aspokesman said: \u2018At the request of the Department for Transport, we can confirm that we have issued a notice to UK airlines (Notam), instructing them to avoid Ukrainian airspace until further notice.\u2019 In response several airlines including Ryanair cancelled planned services. Many had been flying people in and out of Ukraine until yesterday as various countries told their citizens to leave. In a statement, Ryanair said flights were suspended for \u2018at least the next 14 days\u2019 and has removed them from sale for \u2018at least the next four weeks until further information becomes available from EU safety agencies\u2019. Those in Ukraine face a nervous wait to see what happens next (Picture: Reuters) It added: \u2018Ryanair remains committed to our services to/from Ukraine and we look forward to restoring flight services there as soon as it is safe to do so. \u2018We sincerely regret and apologise for these unprecedented disruptions and any inconvenience that they will inevitably cause to our Ukrainian customers.\u2019 Wizz Air cancelled its flights between Luton Airport and the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Lviv on Thursday. The lack of flights will make it harder for British nationals to evacuate from Ukraine to the UK. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged Britons in the country to \u2018leave now via commercial routes while they are still available\u2019. More: RussiaSatellite images reveal what Russia's military build-up really looks likeMaps reveal how much of London would be vapourised in a nuclear attackWhich countries are part of Nato in 2022? After the invasion began, the Foreign Office updated its travel advice to state: \u2018Ukraine\u2019s airspace is closed. It is likely that commercial routes out of Ukraine will be severely disrupted and roads across Ukraine could be closed.\u2019 It added: \u2018Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine will severely affect the British Government\u2019s ability to provide consular assistance in Ukraine. \u2018British nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.\u2019 Flights are continuing to operate over Russia, which is a route used by many services between the UK and Asia. But Russia itself said on Thursday it had suspended domestic flights to and from several airports near its border with Ukraine. In July 2014, Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a missile launched from an area of Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists, killing all 298 people on board.

        "content": "Stocks across Europe, Asia and the US see sharp selloff as military conflict intensifies Stock markets across the world sold off sharply on Thursday after the Russian Armed Forces confirmed the first airstrikes against military targets in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin ordered the operation in the Donbass region to protect the local population against Ukrainian shelling attacks, days after recognizing the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The pan-European Stoxx 600 fell by 2.31% in early trade, with the financial sector leading the losses, sending major bourses sliding into bear territory.\u00a0 European banks most exposed to Russia, including Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank, UniCredit and Societe Generale, fell between 5% and 6.6%, while the wider banking index SX7P dropped 4.3%. Germany\u2019s DAX declined by more than 2.84% to March 2021 lows, bearing the biggest brunt of the selloff on concerns about the country\u2019s deep reliance on energy supplies from Russia. UK\u2019s commodity-heavy FTSE 100 saw a decline of 2.27. Europe\u2019s oil & gas index SX7E lost the least among sectors, down 4.32% as oil prices soared around 6%, pushing Brent crude past $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014.

However, those that need imported oil might get hit by higher prices if supplies from Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest producer and exporter, are disrupted. Major bourses in the region also saw notable declines. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 1.81% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 3.21%. The Shanghai Composite Index was down by 1.70%. The Kospi in Seoul lost 2.6%, Sydney\u2019s S&P-ASX 200 fell 2.99%, New Zealand lost 2.8%, with other Southeast Asian markets also trading in the red.

He said the invasion \u201cboggles the mind\u201d and that everyone needs to fear what Putin could do next. \u201cThe West has always underestimated what Putin could, and would, do \u2026 he\u2019s rewriting history in his own pen and trying to get the world to believe it.\u201d Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on Twitter, saying he prays for the people of Ukraine, and that the invasion is a long time coming. \u201cPutin\u2019s war on Ukraine began in 2014,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis full scale attack, unleashing death and horror on a mass scale, merely makes explicit what he has long planned.\u201d Calling for NATO allies to \u201cstand ready to honour their full treaty commitments,\u201d Harper wrote \u201cPutin and his gang must be treated like the full global pariahs they have chosen to become. They must be sanctioned, excluded and punished at every turn.\u201d Former Conservative MP James Moore called on the federal government to table a motion in Parliament to expel Russian Ambassador Oleg V. Stepanov. Putin warned other countries Wednesday that any attempt to interfere with the Russian military action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d He said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2013 a claim the U.S. had predicted he would falsely make to justify an invasion. In a televised address, Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said Russia\u2019s goal was not to occupy Ukraine. As Putin spoke, big explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other areas of Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\u201d attack on Ukraine and said the world will \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d A full-blown Russian invasion could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government. And the consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent. Putin said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a \u201cdemilitarization\u201d of Ukraine. He urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression.\u201d The announcement immediately fuelled fears that Moscow was offering up a pretext for war, just as the West had warned. A short time later, the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and said a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said.

        "content": "The Ukrainian Premier League has been suspended amid escalating tensions with Russia The Ukrainian Premier League will be suspended for at least 30 days, it has been announced, after President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law in the country. Ukraine\u2019s elite football league\u00a0had been scheduled to resume activity on Friday after the conclusion of its winter break, but confirmed in a message on its official website on Thursday that this will no longer be happening in the wake of the Zelensky's martial declaration. The development also brings into doubt Scotland's proposed World Cup qualifier against Ukraine scheduled to take place in Glasgow on March 24. Elsewhere, it has been speculated that St. Petersburg will be removed as the host of this season's Champions League Final on May 28, although Russian officials have said no discussions on the matter have taken place.\u00a0 Read more Footballer booked after Ukraine gesture in Champions League This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a special operation to defend the newly recognized breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk in Donbass.

        "content": "New Delhi: Amid the tension between Russia and Ukraine, the prices of crude oil rose to $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.Notably, Russia is the world's second largest oil producer, selling crude mainly to European refineries, and the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, sending about 35% of its supply.According to Reuters report, Brent crude hit a high of $101.34 a barrel in early Asia trade, the highest since September 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped $4.22, or 4.6 per cent, to $96.32 a barrel, after rising to as much as $96.51, also the highest since August 2014.However, presently, the Ukraine-Russia crisis is responsible for the rise in crude oil. But apart from this, there are several factors which can keep the prices higher. These bullish drivers also included a strong growth in global oil demand, which exceeded pre-Covid levels this year.The current crisis also assumes significance for India, as it is dependent on imports to meet its crude oil requirements. A rise in crude oil prices may push up domestic prices, leading to inflation.\"It's not just geopolitical risk that is the problem but the further straining of supply,\" OCBC economist Howie Lee was as saying by Reuters.\"Russian oil supply will disappear overnight if faced with sanctions... and OPEC can't produce fast enough to cover this gaping hole,\" he added. What are the 4 main types of crude oil?1: Very light oils \u2013 Jet Fuel, Gasoline, Kerosene, Petroleum Ether, Petroleum Spirit, and Petroleum Naphtha are fall in this category. It is believed to be very volatile, evaporating within a few days which in turn evaporate their toxicity levels.2: Light oils \u2013 Grade 1 and Grade 2 Fuel Oils, Diesel Fuel Oils as well as Most Domestic Fuel Oils are fallin in this catgeory. They are both moderately volatile and toxic.3: Medium oils \u2013 Medium Oils are generally volatility and a higher viscosity higher viscosity. In other words, these are the most common types of Crude Oil. 4: Heavy fuel oils \u2013 These include the heaviest Grade 3,4,5 and 6 Fuel Oils along with Heavy Marine Fuels. These are least volatile Crude Oils as well as the most toxic.What Is OPEC? Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an intergovernmental organization of 13 major oil producing countries, which together produce about 40% of the world's crude. Internationally, OPEC oil exports represent about 60% of the total petroleum traded.OPEC ensures efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum products for the use of various countries. The OPEC countries are Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria, Gabon, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Venezuela and Congo.The organization was founded at the Baghdad Conference on September 10\u201314, 1960. Its headquarter is located in Vienna.Also read: Russia-Ukraine tensions keep crude elevated; negative for net importersAlso watch:",

Disturbing footage originally posted back in 2013 shows a vehicle-mounted incinerator created with the specific purpose of destroying biological waste. Mr Wallace suggested the equipment, capable of \u2018evaporating\u2019 a human body, could be a way for the Kremlin to hide the true number of combat fatalities and avoid the kind of criticism levelled at home when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014. Speaking on Wednesday ahead of Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to press ahead with another invasion, Mr Wallace said if Russia instigated any conflict then \u2018we expect to see some of the things they\u2019ve done previously\u2019. He went on: \u2018Previously, they\u2019ve deployed mobile crematoriums to follow troops around the battlefield, which in anyone\u2019s book is chilling. \u2018If I was a soldier, and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield in a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or a father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was a mobile crematorium \u2013 I\u2019d be deeply, deeply worried. \u2018It\u2019s a very chilling side effect of how the Russians view their forces and for those of you who served, and being a soldier, knowing that trundling behind you is a way to evaporate you if you are killed in battle probably says everything you need to know about the Russian regime.\u2019 Disturbing footage originally posted back in 2013 shows a vehicle-mounted incinerator (Picture: YouTube/zaoTurmalin) The system was created with the specific purpose of destroying biological waste (Picture: YouTube/zaoTurmalin) Damaged radar arrays and other equipment is seen at Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine (Picture: AP) Firefighters work on a fire on a building after bombings on the eastern Ukraine town of Chuguiv (Picture: AFP via Getty) Earlier, he suggested Mr Putin has gone \u2018full tonto\u2019 and made the mistake of having no allies in his latest actions. Mr Wallace, a former Scots Guard officer, compared the Russian President to Tsar Nicholas I during the Crimean War, telling military personnel his regiment had \u2018kicked the backside\u2019 of the tsar in the Crimea and \u2018we can always do it again\u2019. The Cabinet minister said: \u2018It\u2019s going to be a busy Army. \u2018Unfortunately we\u2019ve got a busy adversary now in Putin, who has gone full tonto.\u2019 Mr Wallace said the UK has 1,000 personnel on stand-by to respond to the crisis, adding: \u2018The Scots Guards kicked the backside of Tsar Nicholas I in 1853 in Crimea \u2013 we can always do it again.\u2019 He continued: \u2018Tsar Nicholas I made the same mistake Putin did\u2026 he had no friends, no alliances.\u2019 Mr Wallace said President Putin has gone \u2018full tonto\u2019 (Picture: PA) The Defence Secretary\u2019s comments came in a room dominated by a large painting depicting the Battle of Inkerman, a major engagement during the Crimean War. Mr Wallace\u2019s assessment of Mr Putin\u2019s mental state came after Boris Johnson accused the Russian leader of being \u2018in an illogical and irrational frame of mind\u2019. Former Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen also suggested Mr Putin could be unhinged. \u2018I mean the Russian behaviour right now, it\u2019s not rational, it\u2019s not logical, so I wouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility that Putin has gone crazy,\u2019 the former prime minister of Denmark told ITV\u2019s Peston. \u2018And we saw recently how he actually humiliated his advisers so I don\u2019t think we are confronted with a man who is thinking along rational lines.\u2019 Mr Wallace also told reporters he was keeping the possibility of sending further weapons to Ukraine \u2018under constant review\u2019, adding: \u2018We\u2019re in a pretty good position to deliver any type of aid pretty quickly to Ukraine, no matter what that aid is.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at\u00a0webnews@metro.co.uk.

Bitcoin basics: what you need to know about the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is a completely digital peer-to-peer currency (Credits: Getty Images) Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, which is a virtual or digital currency \u2013 like an online version of cash. It works without a central bank or any formal regulation and is usually exchanged from person-to-person when it is sold or exchanged. Way back in 2008, someone called Satoshi Nakamoto published a nine-page white paper detailing a vision for Bitcoin \u2014 described as a \u2018peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u2019 that would function outside the reach of governments. A few months later, Nakamoto released software that allowed users to 'mine' for the cryptocurrency. Essentially, mining involves a computationally-intensive process to create new Bitcoins. The more Bitcoins are mined, the harder the process becomes - requiring more computer power which gives Bitcoin its environmentally-negative reputation. There are only a finite amount of Bitcoins that can ever be produced and circulated which gives it its scarcity and, in theory, value. People can track their ownership of Bitcoin by using a cryptocurrency wallet, which is a digital way to exchange payments.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Tensions between Russia and Ukraine continued to keep crude oil prices on the boil. On Wednesday, brent-indexed crude oil prices traded at $94-$95 per barrel, which is at its multi-year high.Russia is one of the world's top producers of crude oil and any western sanctions against it will stiffen the global supply. The ongoing crisis also assumes significance for India as it is import-dependent to fulfil its crude oil needs. The rise in crude oil prices can escalate domestic prices, thereby triggering inflation. Crude oil prices rallied as tensions between Russia and West increased after the former ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, leading to supply concerns, brokerage house ICICI Securities said. \"Furthermore, oil prices rallied after US and EU discussed potential sanctions on Russia. EU proposed a ban on buying Russian bonds and sanctions on three Russian banks...\" That said, however, further upside in prices was capped on optimism that reviving Iran's nuclear agreement may bring more oil into the market, the brokerage firm said. \"The global price of oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) is likely to rise sharply in the event of a conflict, which will be positive for the relatively few exporters in the Asia Pacific region and negative for the substantially greater number of net energy importers,\" said Michael Taylor, Managing Director, Moody's Investors Service in a note. However, a mitigating factor is that several Asian economies have long-term supply contracts in place for LNG which will limit the impact of fluctuations in the spot prices, Taylor added. \"Trade effects are likely to arise from import diversion and diversification, although there may be opportunities for commodities producers in Central Asia to increase supply to China. Supply chain bottlenecks would also be aggravated, adding to inflation pressures in the region.\" (IANS) Also read:\u00a0 Equities, Crude oil crash on fears over new COVID variantAlso Watch:",

        "content": "In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of Feb. 24 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada condemns Russia\u2019s egregious attack on Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. In a statement issued late Wednesday, Trudeau called on Russia to immediately cease all hostile and provocative actions against Ukraine and withdraw all military and proxy forces from the country. \u201cThese unprovoked actions are a clear further violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThey are also in violation of Russia\u2019s obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected and the Ukrainian people must be free to determine their own future.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d He said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a claim the U-S had predicted he would falsely make to justify an invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged global leaders to provide defense assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace from Russia. Zelenskyy said that Russia \u201chas unleased a war with Ukraine and the entire democratic world,\u201d and asked for world leaders to provide large-scale defense support and to protect Ukraine\u2019s airspace from the \u201caggressor.\u201d Trudeau said Russia\u2019s actions will be met with severe consequences. He said he would be meeting Thursday with G7 partners and would work quickly with NATO and Canada\u2019s allies \u201cto collectively respond to these reckless and dangerous acts, including by imposing significant sanctions in addition to those already announced.\u201d \u2014 Also this \u2026 The federal government has lifted the Emergencies Act but questions remain about what might be the long-term effects of invoking such extraordinary measures to quell protests. The financial measures carried out under the act, which included directing banks to freeze some protesters\u2019 accounts, have been a particular target for criticism and one watcher warns the damage done will linger long after the initial protests are finished. Financial intelligence expert Kim Manchester says that banks will likely keep tracking those individuals flagged by the RCMP and their names could end up on private-sector third-party databases that banks rely on to mitigate anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks and other financial institutions were also directed to look into whether any clients seemed to be supporting the protests, and those monitoring actions could well continue, he said. On a larger scale, Manchester says that the actions set a dangerous precedent of how government decides to go after protests, and leaves open the door to using the same tactics in the future. He says allies will also be watching how the federal government used Fintrac and compare the actions against the protesters to the relatively few resources directed to financial crime generally. \u201cThere are lasting consequences to this. You don\u2019t just pull out a fountain pain and sign a piece of paper and hope that it all goes away. It doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d said Manchester, managing director of financial intelligence training company ManchesterCF. For its part, the Canadian Bankers Association said that financial institutions moved quickly to unfreeze accounts after the RCMP cleared the individuals and entities flagged for concern, but that some accounts may still be frozen. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 ST. PAUL, Minn. _ A jury will resume deliberations this morning in the trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with violating George Floyd\u2019s civil rights after reaching no verdict in its first day. Jurors met for about seven hours Wednesday with no decision on the charges against J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. All three are charged of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as fellow Officer Derek Chauvin pinned the 46-year-old Black man to the ground for 9 1/2 minutes with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter, and later pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge. Kueng and Thao are also charged with failing to intervene in the May 25, 2020, killing that was captured on bystander video that triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing. Prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments that the three officers \u201cchose to do nothing\u201d as Chauvin squeezed the life out of the 46-year-old Black man. Defense attorneys countered that the officers were too inexperienced, weren\u2019t trained properly and did not wilfully violate Floyd\u2019s rights. Prosecutors sought to show during the month-long trial that the officers violated their training, including when they failed to roll Floyd onto his side or give him CPR. They argued that Floyd\u2019s condition was so serious that even bystanders without basic medical training could see he needed help. But the defense said the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s training was inadequate and that the officers deferred to Chauvin as the senior officer at the scene. Federal civil rights violations that result in death are punishable by up to life in prison or even death, but those sentences are extremely rare, and federal sentencing guidelines suggest the officers would get much less if convicted. Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate trial in June on state charges alleging that they aided and abetted murder and manslaughter. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 MOSCOW _ Russian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Ukrainian border guards released footage of what they said were Russian military vehicles moving in, and big explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odesa in the west. As the Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine\u2019s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, Ukrainians fled some cities and European authorities declared Ukrainian air space an active conflict zone. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault, while never knowing precisely when it would come, were urged to stay home and not to panic even as the country\u2019s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighbouring Belarus. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy. Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine _ a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice. Biden in a written statement condemned the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified attack,\u201d and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d and said Ukraine will \u201cdefend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d \u2014 On this day in 1986 \u2026 Tommy Douglas, remembered as the father of medicare, died at age 81. As Saskatchewan premier from 1944-61, he implemented Canada\u2019s first public hospital insurance program. In 1962, a year after Douglas became the federal NDP leader, Saskatchewan introduced North America\u2019s first socialized health plan. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 LOS ANGELES _ The husband of a cinematographer shot and killed on the set of the film \u201cRust\u201d says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that Alec Baldwin believes he\u2019s not to blame for the shooting and he was \u201cso angry\u201d when Baldwin didn\u2019t accept responsibility. The remarks made in excerpts released Wednesday from an interview with the \u201cToday\u201d show are the first public words from Matt Hutchins on the Oct. 21 death of his wife Halyna Hutchins. \u201cThe idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd to me,\u201d Matt Hutchins told \u201dToday\u201d host Hoda Kotb in the interview that airs in full Thursday. Baldwin said in a December interview with ABC News that he was pointing the gun at Halyna Hutchins at her instruction on the New Mexico set of the Western when it went off without his pulling the trigger, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. \u201cWatching him I just felt so angry,\u201d Hutchins said. \u201dI was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her.\u201d Baldwin said in his interview that \u201csomeone is responsible for what happened, and I can\u2019t say who that is, but it\u2019s not me.\u201d Matt Hutchins and his nine-year-old son are the plaintiffs in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed last week that names Baldwin, the film\u2019s producers and others as defendants. It alleges that Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, and his co-producers showed \u201ccallous\u201d disregard in the face of safety complaints, and their \u201creckless conduct and cost-cutting measures\u201d led directly to her death. \u2014 Did you see this? FREDERICTON _ A report from an oversight committee studying possible cases of a mysterious neurological disease in New Brunswick will be released Thursday. Last March, New Brunswick health officials alerted the province\u2019s doctors, nurses and pharmacists about a possible cluster of residents with an unknown and potentially new neurological syndrome with symptoms similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Since then, 48 people have been identified in the cluster, and families of the patients are to meet virtually with Health Minister Dorothy Shephard Thursday ahead of the report\u2019s publication. According to the New Brunswick Health Department, the first suspected case dates to 2015 but wasn\u2019t identified until early 2020. Symptoms included rapidly progressing dementia, muscle spasms, atrophy and a host of other complications. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was ruled out in the New Brunswick cases. Of the original 48 patients, nine have died. The Health Department\u2019s website says autopsies completed on six individuals confirmed they died of known causes or diseases. Last October, Shephard raised questions about the existence of a mystery brain syndrome. \u201cForty-six of the 48 cases are from one neurologist. We need to make this bigger than one neurologist,\u201d Shephard told reporters at the time. She said an epidemiological study found no known food, behaviour or environmental exposure that could have caused the symptoms. The minister appointed a committee of six neurologists from the province to conduct a clinical review of the cases. In recent days, many of the patients in the cluster have received letters from the committee informing them they don\u2019t have an unknown neurological condition and should contact their doctor for more details. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 24, 2022.

In a statement issued late Wednesday, Trudeau called on Russia to immediately cease all hostile and provocative actions against Ukraine and withdraw all military and proxy forces from the country. \u201cThese unprovoked actions are a clear further violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThey are also in violation of Russia\u2019s obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected and the Ukrainian people must be free to determine their own future.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d He said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a claim the U-S had predicted he would falsely make to justify an invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged global leaders to provide defense assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace from Russia. Zelenskyy said that Russia \u201chas unleased a war with Ukraine and the entire democratic world,\u201d and asked for world leaders to provide large-scale defense support and to protect Ukraine\u2019s airspace from the \u201caggressor.\u201d Trudeau said Russia\u2019s actions will be met with severe consequences. He said he would be meeting Thursday with G7 partners and would work quickly with NATO and Canada\u2019s allies \u201cto collectively respond to these reckless and dangerous acts, including by imposing significant sanctions in addition to those already announced.\u201d \u2014 Also this \u2026 The federal government has lifted the Emergencies Act but questions remain about what might be the long-term effects of invoking such extraordinary measures to quell protests. The financial measures carried out under the act, which included directing banks to freeze some protesters\u2019 accounts, have been a particular target for criticism and one watcher warns the damage done will linger long after the initial protests are finished. Financial intelligence expert Kim Manchester says that banks will likely keep tracking those individuals flagged by the RCMP and their names could end up on private-sector third-party databases that banks rely on to mitigate anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks and other financial institutions were also directed to look into whether any clients seemed to be supporting the protests, and those monitoring actions could well continue, he said. On a larger scale, Manchester says that the actions set a dangerous precedent of how government decides to go after protests, and leaves open the door to using the same tactics in the future. He says allies will also be watching how the federal government used Fintrac and compare the actions against the protesters to the relatively few resources directed to financial crime generally. \u201cThere are lasting consequences to this. You don\u2019t just pull out a fountain pain and sign a piece of paper and hope that it all goes away. It doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d said Manchester, managing director of financial intelligence training company ManchesterCF. For its part, the Canadian Bankers Association said that financial institutions moved quickly to unfreeze accounts after the RCMP cleared the individuals and entities flagged for concern, but that some accounts may still be frozen. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 ST. PAUL, Minn. _ A jury will resume deliberations this morning in the trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with violating George Floyd\u2019s civil rights after reaching no verdict in its first day. Jurors met for about seven hours Wednesday with no decision on the charges against J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. All three are charged of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as fellow Officer Derek Chauvin pinned the 46-year-old Black man to the ground for 9 1/2 minutes with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter, and later pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge. Kueng and Thao are also charged with failing to intervene in the May 25, 2020, killing that was captured on bystander video that triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing. Prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments that the three officers \u201cchose to do nothing\u201d as Chauvin squeezed the life out of the 46-year-old Black man. Defense attorneys countered that the officers were too inexperienced, weren\u2019t trained properly and did not wilfully violate Floyd\u2019s rights. Prosecutors sought to show during the month-long trial that the officers violated their training, including when they failed to roll Floyd onto his side or give him CPR. They argued that Floyd\u2019s condition was so serious that even bystanders without basic medical training could see he needed help. But the defense said the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s training was inadequate and that the officers deferred to Chauvin as the senior officer at the scene. Federal civil rights violations that result in death are punishable by up to life in prison or even death, but those sentences are extremely rare, and federal sentencing guidelines suggest the officers would get much less if convicted. Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate trial in June on state charges alleging that they aided and abetted murder and manslaughter. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 MOSCOW _ Russian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Ukrainian border guards released footage of what they said were Russian military vehicles moving in, and big explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odesa in the west. As the Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine\u2019s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, Ukrainians fled some cities and European authorities declared Ukrainian air space an active conflict zone. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault, while never knowing precisely when it would come, were urged to stay home and not to panic even as the country\u2019s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighbouring Belarus. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy. Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine _ a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice. Biden in a written statement condemned the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified attack,\u201d and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d and said Ukraine will \u201cdefend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d \u2014 On this day in 1986 \u2026 Tommy Douglas, remembered as the father of medicare, died at age 81. As Saskatchewan premier from 1944-61, he implemented Canada\u2019s first public hospital insurance program. In 1962, a year after Douglas became the federal NDP leader, Saskatchewan introduced North America\u2019s first socialized health plan. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 LOS ANGELES _ The husband of a cinematographer shot and killed on the set of the film \u201cRust\u201d says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that Alec Baldwin believes he\u2019s not to blame for the shooting and he was \u201cso angry\u201d when Baldwin didn\u2019t accept responsibility. The remarks made in excerpts released Wednesday from an interview with the \u201cToday\u201d show are the first public words from Matt Hutchins on the Oct. 21 death of his wife Halyna Hutchins. \u201cThe idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd to me,\u201d Matt Hutchins told \u201dToday\u201d host Hoda Kotb in the interview that airs in full Thursday. Baldwin said in a December interview with ABC News that he was pointing the gun at Halyna Hutchins at her instruction on the New Mexico set of the Western when it went off without his pulling the trigger, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. \u201cWatching him I just felt so angry,\u201d Hutchins said. \u201dI was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her.\u201d Baldwin said in his interview that \u201csomeone is responsible for what happened, and I can\u2019t say who that is, but it\u2019s not me.\u201d Matt Hutchins and his nine-year-old son are the plaintiffs in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed last week that names Baldwin, the film\u2019s producers and others as defendants. It alleges that Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, and his co-producers showed \u201ccallous\u201d disregard in the face of safety complaints, and their \u201creckless conduct and cost-cutting measures\u201d led directly to her death. \u2014 Did you see this? FREDERICTON _ A report from an oversight committee studying possible cases of a mysterious neurological disease in New Brunswick will be released Thursday. Last March, New Brunswick health officials alerted the province\u2019s doctors, nurses and pharmacists about a possible cluster of residents with an unknown and potentially new neurological syndrome with symptoms similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Since then, 48 people have been identified in the cluster, and families of the patients are to meet virtually with Health Minister Dorothy Shephard Thursday ahead of the report\u2019s publication. According to the New Brunswick Health Department, the first suspected case dates to 2015 but wasn\u2019t identified until early 2020. Symptoms included rapidly progressing dementia, muscle spasms, atrophy and a host of other complications. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was ruled out in the New Brunswick cases. Of the original 48 patients, nine have died. The Health Department\u2019s website says autopsies completed on six individuals confirmed they died of known causes or diseases. Last October, Shephard raised questions about the existence of a mystery brain syndrome. \u201cForty-six of the 48 cases are from one neurologist. We need to make this bigger than one neurologist,\u201d Shephard told reporters at the time. She said an epidemiological study found no known food, behaviour or environmental exposure that could have caused the symptoms. The minister appointed a committee of six neurologists from the province to conduct a clinical review of the cases. In recent days, many of the patients in the cluster have received letters from the committee informing them they don\u2019t have an unknown neurological condition and should contact their doctor for more details. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 24, 2022.

        "content": "Multiple targets have been hit across Ukraine (Picture: east2west news) An airstrike map appears to show that a military strike hit an area near Chernobyl on Thursday. Multiple missile attacks have battered Ukraine since Russia launched an invasion likely to spark the worst war on European soil since 1945. One of those incidents appears to have been around the Chernobyl zone, north of Kyiv and west of a major river \u2013 but it is unclear exactly how close it was. Elsewhere, strikes hit dozens of locations scattered across the country, in the map released by BNO news. At 08.36 in the Odessa region in the city of Podilsk, a bombing left six dead, seven wounded, and 19 missing, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry earlier this morning. Then around two minutes later, in the city of Mariupil, Donetsk region, one person was killed and two were injured in the shelling. In the city of Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk region, there were three strikes on military depots and the bridge over the Ingulets River was bombed.

        "description": "Amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions, 242 Indian students returned safely to India at New Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International airport",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions, 242 Indian students returned safely to India at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International airport late Tuesday evening and reunited with their parents after India started evacuation operations of Indian citizens living in Ukraine and its adjoining areas.India has deployed Dreamliner B-787 aircraft for carrying out this special operation under which flights were made operational from Kharkiv in Ukraine to New Delhi. Nirav Patil, a first-year MBBS student studying in Ukraine, said, \"The situation is normal around the area where I live. While the university has started studies online so there is not much to worry as before.\" Another student Krishna said, \"I live 900 km away from the Ukraine-Russia border. We are around five to six students, who are residents of Gujarat. Our parents were getting quite worried. This is why we had to return to India.\" Several government officials were also sent by the Rajasthan government to the Delhi airport as well as students of Rajasthan who have returned from Ukraine, the state government is busy preparing to send them safely to their home bearing their travel expenses. At present, eight students along with their parents have been asked to stay at the Rajasthan Bhawan. However, there are several Indian students who have not returned to India by an Air India flight. Monika, a resident of Chhattisgarh and a fifth-year MBBS student, first took a flight from Kyiv to Doha and then returned to Delhi. According to her, air tickets were quite expensive due to which she came to India taking other flights. She did not express her opinion on the tense situation in Ukraine as many of her Indian friends are still stuck in Ukraine. She said, \"In some places, studies have been made online but in several other places offline studies are still being followed as the norm. My parents were getting quite worried due to which I had to return to India, but the situation in Ukraine is still normal. Now only if our parents ask us to return to Ukraine only then will we return.\" Air India on February 19 had announced that it would operate flights between India and Ukraine on February 22, 24 and 26. Booking of air tickets is open through Air India booking offices, website, call centres and authorised travel agents. According to the Indian embassy in Ukraine, additional flights from Kyiv to Delhi will operate on February 25, 27 (two flights) and March 6. At the same time, many students who have returned to India are worried about their studies while some said they had also recently seen a tank used in a war in the city where they lived. Swati, who is a second-year MBBS student, on returning to Delhi, said, \"The situation is normal in Ukraine and I was living a completely normal life there. The people residing there are not worried at all about the Russia-Ukraine tensions.\" \"The reason for many students like me returning to India is because of my parents. They were quite mentally disturbed and were worried about my well-being. Now since I have returned back home, our studies will suffer too. But the university where I was studying will start holding online classes. I have exams scheduled for next year.\" Another student Tanvi, who is an MBBS student, arrived in Delhi and spoke about the tense situation in Ukraine, saying, \"The situation is pretty worse in Ukraine, I am quite distressed. Children studying here are living in fear, every day different kind of news is coming to fore as one is not able to come to judge which ones to believe. At the same time, air tickets have also become quite expensive.\" The parents of the students also arrived at the airport to pick up their children, but are angry due to the expensive air tickets.

        "content": "New Delhi: Ukraine has urged its citizens living in Russia to leave the country immediately, BBC reported.Up to three million Ukrainians are believed to be living in Russia and many have family in both countries. In addition, a state of emergency is to be declared in Ukraine, lasting 30 days, the country's top security official said. Ukraine is also conscripting reservists into the regular military as it braces for a possible invasion by its neighbour, Russia. Western countries and their allies have imposed sanctions on Russian banks and MPs, as the crisis escalates. But critics, among them the UK's Labour Party, say the measures so far are not strong enough. It's not clear if any new Russian troops have yet been sent into the two regions, which are run by Moscow-backed separatists. A state of emergency across the whole country is set to be declared, following a recommendation from Ukraine's security council. This will last 30 days, but is subject to approval by the Ukrainian parliament - expected later on Wednesday, BBC reported. Ukraine military has also called up a first wave of reservists - aged 18 to 60 - to join the regular armed forces.Also read: S Korea Rules Out Military Support, Deployment Over Ukraine CrisisAlso watch:\u00a0",

The state border force earlier said Belarusian forces had joined in with the assault, with convoys entering Ukraine from the north. Belarus \u2013 a Russian puppet state which has been housing Kremlin forces for several weeks \u2013 lies around 50 miles north of Kyiv.

China has increasingly aligned its foreign policy with Russia to challenge the West, and has blamed the United States and its allies for provoking Moscow. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said sanctions against Russia would become law Friday but would not take effect until the end of March.

Targets across Ukraine have been hit by rocket strikes, including in the capital Kyiv, and there are reports some cities have already fallen to Russian forces. Hundreds are feared to have been killed already after a comprehensive attack on military targets and critical infrastructure.\u00a0 Many woke up to the news of the assault on Thursday morning, with former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers condemning Mr Putin\u2019s actions. \u2018This is an act of war by a bully-boy thug who doesn\u2019t think the rest of the world has the guts or will to stop him,\u2019 he wrote in one post. \u2018Shameful.\u2019 In a separate tweet, he added: \u2018Putin\u2019s doing this because he got away with it last time in Crimea.

The leader also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u2018consequences they have never seen\u2019.

The Russian President gave a chilling waring to the West after declaring war on his neighbour. Explosions were heard in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, as the country came under attack following weeks of military build up at the border. In an early Thursday morning address in Moscow Putin said: \u2018To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside \u2013 if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.\u2019 The United Nations Security Council had just convened an emergency meeting when Putin took to Russian airwaves to announce the invasion at 5:50am Moscow time.

Too many people have already died.\u2019 Putin ignored the plea, going on TV to describe the invasion as a \u2018special military occupation\u2019 and said he wants to \u2018demilitarize\u2019 and \u2018de-Nazify\u2019, not occupy, the country. He told Ukrainian service members to \u2018lay down their arms and go home,\u2019 saying Russia could not exist with a \u2018constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine\u2019 and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian solders was \u2018inevitable.\u2019 Shortly afterwards, targets across Ukraine were hit by rocket strikes, including in the capital Kyiv.

Hundreds are feared to have been killed already after a comprehensive attack on military targets and critical infrastructure.\u00a0 There has reportedly been heavy bombing in Odessa, the seat of Ukraine\u2019s navy, which is feared to have been crippled already. Troops are flooding into eastern cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol, witnesses have said. Air raid sirens have sounded across the country and communication systems have been hit by cyberattacks. Ukraine\u2019s border guards said it was under attack \u2018with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and firearms\u2019 in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr. Putin issued a chilling warning for the West not to get involved (Picture:: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES) Videos posted on social media showed smoke rising above several Ukrainian cities and there are unconfirmed reports Russian paratroopers have moved to take control of Kyiv. The attack comes after a number of countries imposed sanctions on Russian banks and oligarchs, including the UK. Many vowed to go further if the country stepped up its aggression. President Joe Biden responded on Wednesday night, saying: \u2018The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. \u2018President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. \u2018Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.

        "content": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian troops launched their anticipated attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Big explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. He urged Ukrainians to stay home and not to panic. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy. Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also credulously claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice. Biden in a written statement condemned the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified attack,\u201d and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d Biden said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d and said Ukraine will \u201cdefend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city. The Russian military said it struck Ukrainian air bases and other military assets and had not targeted populated areas. The Russian Defense Ministry statement said the military was using precision weapons and claimed that \u201cthere is no threat to civilian population.\u201d Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro. After the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm. Beyond casualties that could overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s government, the consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent. Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance. Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, \u201cwhoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.\u201d Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d In a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, Putin warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d He emphasized that Russia is \u201cone of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.\u201d Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia. Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that the White House said was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion. Putin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said. He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: \u201cStop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning \u201cRussia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.\u201d European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable. \u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d they said on Twitter. Even before Putin\u2019s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets. The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine\u2019s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos. ___ Karmanau and Heintz reported from Kyiv.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that the White House said was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion. Putin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said. He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: \u201cStop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning \u201cRussia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.\u201d European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable. \u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d they said on Twitter. Even before Putin\u2019s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets. The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine\u2019s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos. ___ Karmanau and Heintz reported from Kyiv.

        "description": "Kyiv has been hit and a number of cities have reportedly already fallen after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion to begin.",
        "content": "Ukraine has come under a blistering assault in recent hours after Vladimir Putin ordered an attack (Picture: Reuters/East2west) Ukraine is under heavy attack by Russian forces after Vladimir Putin finally gave the order for his invasion to begin. Targets across the country have been hit by rocket strikes, including in the capital Kyiv, and there are reports some cities have already fallen to Russian forces. Hundreds are feared to have been killed already after a comprehensive attack on military targets and critical infrastructure.\u00a0 There has reportedly been heavy bombing in Odessa, the seat of Ukraine\u2019s navy, which is feared to have been crippled already. Troops are flooding into eastern cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol, witnesses have said. Air raid sirens have sounded across the country and communication systems have been hit by cyberattacks. Ukraine\u2019s border guards said it was under attack \u2018with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and firearms\u2019 in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr. Videos posted on social media showed smoke rising above several Ukrainian cities and there are unconfirmed reports Russian paratroopers have moved to take control of Kyiv airport. Explosions have been heard around the capital city of Kyiv (Picture: Reuters) Speaking from an undisclosed location, the president of Ukraine declared martial law and vowed the army would resist. The attack began minutes after the Russian president concluded a televised address announcing a \u2018special military operation\u2019. Shortly before 4am GMT, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said: \u2018Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.\u00a0 \u2018This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u2019 Boris Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting at 7.30am and fresh sanctions and other measures are expected to be announced by the West. The Ukrainian government has appealed for military and humanitarian aid. Russia has been steadily building a force of up to 200,000 on the border for several months, heavily outnumbering its neighbour\u2019s army. Ukraine\u2019s military has been preparing for an assault with the assistance of Western allies but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations. The conflict between the countries began in 2014 when a popular revolution saw the pro-Moscow government in Kyiv swept away. In response, Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists forces in the eastern Donbas region declared their independence, triggering years of grinding conflict which has claimed thousands of lives. Russian president Vladimir Putin penned a long essay last year setting out his ethno-nationalist belief that Ukraine is destined to be a part of Russia, a clear warning he did not intend to stop at the Crimean peninsula.\u00a0 US and UK intelligence has long warned Russia could use a range of military tactics to attack Ukraine. As well as ground troops, naval forces in the Black Sea and aerial capability, Russia is also known to be adept at deploying cyber warfare. Mr Putin has kept the world guessing about his true intentions in recent months and at times has appeared to suggest a willingness to engage with diplomatic talks, despite preparing for an incursion. As well as troops and military hardware, satellites over Russia and Belarus have identified conflict infrastructure like field hospitals under construction close to Ukraine. Tensions were ratcheted up once more on February 15 when Mr Putin accused Ukraine of \u2018genocide\u2019 against Russian speakers in the east of the country, a thinly veiled attempt to create a pseudo-legitimate pretext for invading. Several senior figures have visited Vladimir Putin to try and convince him to pull back, including French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has held several rounds of high level talks with Western politicians and military figures in recent weeks. Nato allies have ruled out a military response to any invasion but have promised to respond with an unprecedented package of sanctions, some of which were rolled out earlier this week after Moscow formally recognised the illegal republics in the Donbas region. Recents months have also seen Nato military deployments on the continent\u2019s Eastern flank bolstered with personnel and equipment, including from the UK. The full scale invasion comes after months of demands from Moscow about fundamentally reorganising defence arrangements in Europe. The Russian president has demanded Ukraine be permanently blocked from joining the Nato military alliance, as well as calling for missiles to be moved away from Russia\u2019s border. Led by the US, Nato rejected Mr Putin\u2019s key demands but signalled there was room for maneuver on some secondary issues. Speaking after talks with Germany\u2019s leader in the Kremlin, he said he was open to discussing disarmament and other changes to bolster relations between East and West. But he made it clear there was still a huge chasm between his demands on what the West was willing to compromise on, pouring cold water on hopes of a deescalation. Mr Putin also declined to rule out formally recognising the breakaway republic in Donetsk and Luhansk, a move which would kill any lingering hopes of a peace process stone dead.

Precision weapons are used against military infrastructure, air defense sites, military airfields and aircraft, a statement cited by RIA Novosti said. The military said that Russia was not attacking Ukrainian cities, contrary to claims that say otherwise. Ukrainian civilians are not under threat, the statement said. Earlier on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he had authorized a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.

Putin recognized the two regions as sovereign states on Monday and vowed to use Russian armed forces to protect them. The republics claim large chunks of territory controlled by Ukraine as under their sovereignty. Russia recognized those claims.\u00a0On Wednesday, the two republics demanded that Ukraine pull back its troops to the border lines of what Kiev considers to be Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Ukraine, which Kiev refused to do. Leaders of the republics said Ukrainian troops continued to attack their positions and asked Russia\u2019s help in repelling them. DETAILS TO FOLLOW",

Ukraine has been accusing Russia of illegally occupying Crimea, which was reabsorbed by Russia following a referendum in March 2015, which was preceded by the US-backed coup that overthrew the elected government in Kiev. Kiev has also repeatedly accused Russia of having a military presence in Donbass, although Moscow consistently denied this claim.",

        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (NewsNation Now) \u2014 Russian troops launched their anticipated attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d Big explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later in an announcement called the incursion \"an unjustified deceitful and cynical invasion\" and declared martial law. He later asked via Twitter to \"close airspace,\" which NewsNation's Leland Vittert interpreted as asking the West to impose a no-fly zone. \"Ukrainians will never give up their freedom and independence to anyone,\" Zelenskyy stated. \"Only we, all citizens of Ukraine, have been determining our future since 1991. But now the fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what life in Europe will be like.\" The above graphic shows the build up of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The outlook for Ukraine is bleak. Retired Lt. Gen. Richard Newton said the Ukrainian forces are \u201cnot a match\u201d for the Russia army.\u00a0Newton predicted Ukraine could fall to the Russian military in about four days, and thought Russia could have air superiority in the country within a matter of hours. Russia said it has targeted Ukrainian air bases and other military assets. Reports from U.S. officials indicated troops were strategically moving in to cut Ukrainian forces off from Kyiv and take control of its airport, while troops moved in from Belarus, Crimea and Russia. Ukraine's military claimed five Russian planes and a Russian helicopter were shot down in Luhansk region, according to Reuters. In the early-morning hours of Thursday in Ukraine, smoke could be seen rising from the capital and later on air-raid sirens forced rang through the city, which turned out to be a drill. Some journalists donned flack jackets and helmets as they delivered live reports. RELATED: \u2018Cold War Two\u2019: Retired Lt.

But it is a full-scale war,\u201d Green said Wednesday night. \u201cThis is an invasion of the entire country of Ukraine.\u201d RELATED: Will the Ukraine conflict go nuclear? Experts answer The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent. Asian stock markets have plunged and oil prices surged soon after Putin announced his move on Ukraine. Market benchmarks in Tokyo and Seoul fell 2 percent and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3 percent Thursday. Oil prices jumped nearly $3 per barrel on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 percent to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance. Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression.\" The announcement immediately fueled fears that Moscow was offering up a pretext for war, just as the West had warned. A short time later, the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and said a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

        "description": "Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d",
        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a military operation in Ukraine, claiming it\u2019s intended to protect civilians. In a televised address, Putin said the action comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine. He added that Russia doesn\u2019t have a goal to occupy Ukraine. Putin said the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian \u201cregime.\u201d Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a \u201cdemilitarization\u201d of Ukraine. Putin said that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to Putin\u2019s remarks, but U.S. officials have repeatedly pledged to place overwhelming sanctions on the Russian economy and Putin allies in retaliation for a further invasion of Ukraine. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance Wednesday to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that immediately fueled fears that Moscow was offering up a pretext for war, just as the West had warned. Why does the US care so much about Ukraine? Experts break down the conflict with Russia A short time later, the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and said a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said. He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d The United Nations Security Council quickly scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night at Ukraine's request. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the separatists\u2019 request \u201ca further escalation of the security situation.\u201d Wall Street losses deepen amid simmering Ukraine crisis Anxiety about an imminent Russian offensive against its neighbor soared after Putin recognized the separatist regions' independence on Monday, endorsed the deployment of troops to the rebel territories and received parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country. The West responded with sanctions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the rebel chiefs wrote to Putin on Wednesday, pleading with him to intervene after Ukrainian shelling caused civilian deaths and crippled vital infrastructure. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the separatists' request for Russian help was an example of the sort of \u201cfalse-flag\u201d operation that the U.S. and its allies have expected Moscow to use as a pretense for war. \"So we\u2019ll continue to call out what we see as false-flag operations or efforts to spread misinformation about what the actual status is on the ground,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Ukrainian lawmakers approved a decree that imposes a nationwide state of emergency for 30 days starting Thursday. The measure allows authorities to declare curfews and other restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations \u201cin the interests of national security and public order.\u201d The action reflected increasing concern among Ukrainian authorities after weeks of trying to project calm. The Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended that any Ukrainians who are there leave immediately. \u201cFor a long time, we refrained from declaring a state of emergency ... but today the situation has become more complicated,\u201c Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council head Oleksiy Danilov told parliament, emphasizing that Moscow's efforts to destabilize Ukraine represented the main threat. Will the Ukraine conflict go nuclear? Experts answer Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the Russian force of more than 150,000 troops arrayed along Ukraine\u2019s borders is in an advanced state of readiness. \u201cThey are ready to go right now,\u201d Kirby said. The latest images released by the Maxar satellite image company showed Russian troops and military equipment deployed within 10 miles of the Ukrainian border and less than 50 miles from Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv. Early Thursday, airspace over all of Ukraine was shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice to airmen. A commercial flight tracking website showed that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine was a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane, which began flying westward early Thursday after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory. Another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks hit Ukraine\u2019s parliament and other government and banking websites on Wednesday, and cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had also infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware. Officials have long said they expect cyberattacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion, and analysts said the incidents hew to a nearly two-decade-old Russian playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression. In other developments, Russia evacuated its embassy in Kyiv; Ukraine recalled its ambassador to Russia and considered breaking all diplomatic ties with Moscow and dozens of nations further squeezed Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets. Kremlin says rebels have asked Russia for military aid against Ukrainian \u2018aggression\u2019 President Joe Biden allowed sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cAs I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Putin had launched \u201cthe beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d by sending troops into the separatist regions. The pipeline is complete but has not yet begun operating. Putin said Tuesday that he had not yet sent any Russian troops into the rebel regions, contrary to Western claims, and Donetsk rebel leader Denis Pushilin insisted Wednesday there were no Russian troops in the region, even though a local council member claimed the previous day they had moved in. Already, the threat of war has shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos. European Union sanctions against Russia took effect, targeting several companies along with 351 Russian lawmakers who voted for a motion urging Putin to recognize the rebel regions and 27 senior government officials, business executives and top military officers. The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d In Ukraine's east, one Ukrainian soldier was killed and six more wounded after rebel shelling, the Ukrainian military said Wednesday. Separatist officials reported several explosions on their territory overnight and three civilian deaths. Facing a barrage of criticism at the 193-member United Nations General Assembly, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, warned Ukraine that Russia will monitor a cease-fire in the east and emphasized that \u201cno one intends to go softly, softly with any violators.\u201d \u201cA new military adventure\u201d by Kyiv \u201cmight cost the whole of Ukraine very dearly,\u201d he warned ominously. After weeks of rising tensions, Putin's steps this week dramatically raised the stakes. He\u00a0recognized the independence of the separatist regions, a move he said extends even to the large parts of the territories now held by Ukrainian forces, and had parliament grant him authority to use military force outside the country. Putin laid out three conditions that he said could end the standoff, urging Kyiv to renounce its bid to join NATO, to partially demilitarize and to recognize Russia\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine long has rejected such demands.",

        "description": "Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d",
        "content": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday announced a military operation in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to \u201cconsequences they have never seen.\u201d He said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2013 a claim the U.S. had predicted he would falsely make to justify an invasion. In a televised address, Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said Russia's goal was not to occupy Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\u201d attack on Ukraine and said the world will \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d As Putin spoke, big explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other areas of Ukraine. A full-blown Russian invasion could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government. And the consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent. He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a \u201cdemilitarization\u201d of Ukraine. Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d Why does the US care so much about Ukraine? Experts break down the conflict with Russia Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression.\" The announcement immediately fueled fears that Moscow was offering up a pretext for war, just as the West had warned. A short time later, the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and said a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond. In an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d \u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said. He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d The United Nations Security Council quickly scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night at Ukraine's request. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the separatists\u2019 request \u201ca further escalation of the security situation.\u201d Wall Street losses deepen amid simmering Ukraine crisis Anxiety about an imminent Russian offensive against its neighbor soared after Putin recognized the separatist regions' independence on Monday, endorsed the deployment of troops to the rebel territories and received parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country. The West responded with sanctions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the rebel chiefs wrote to Putin on Wednesday, pleading with him to intervene after Ukrainian shelling caused civilian deaths and crippled vital infrastructure. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the separatists' request for Russian help was an example of the sort of \u201cfalse-flag\u201d operation that the U.S. and its allies have expected Moscow to use as a pretense for war. \"So we\u2019ll continue to call out what we see as false-flag operations or efforts to spread misinformation about what the actual status is on the ground,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Ukrainian lawmakers approved a decree that imposes a nationwide state of emergency for 30 days starting Thursday. The measure allows authorities to declare curfews and other restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations \u201cin the interests of national security and public order.\u201d The action reflected increasing concern among Ukrainian authorities after weeks of trying to project calm. The Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended that any Ukrainians who are there leave immediately. \u201cFor a long time, we refrained from declaring a state of emergency ... but today the situation has become more complicated,\u201c Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council head Oleksiy Danilov told parliament, emphasizing that Moscow's efforts to destabilize Ukraine represented the main threat. Will the Ukraine conflict go nuclear? Experts answer Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the Russian force of more than 150,000 troops arrayed along Ukraine\u2019s borders is in an advanced state of readiness. \u201cThey are ready to go right now,\u201d Kirby said. The latest images released by the Maxar satellite image company showed Russian troops and military equipment deployed within 10 miles of the Ukrainian border and less than 50 miles from Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv. Early Thursday, airspace over all of Ukraine was shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice to airmen. A commercial flight tracking website showed that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine was a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane, which began flying westward early Thursday after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory. Another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks hit Ukraine\u2019s parliament and other government and banking websites on Wednesday, and cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had also infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware. Officials have long said they expect cyberattacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion, and analysts said the incidents hew to a nearly two-decade-old Russian playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression. In other developments, Russia evacuated its embassy in Kyiv; Ukraine recalled its ambassador to Russia and considered breaking all diplomatic ties with Moscow and dozens of nations further squeezed Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets. Kremlin says rebels have asked Russia for military aid against Ukrainian \u2018aggression\u2019 President Joe Biden allowed sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cAs I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Putin had launched \u201cthe beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d by sending troops into the separatist regions. The pipeline is complete but has not yet begun operating. Putin said Tuesday that he had not yet sent any Russian troops into the rebel regions, contrary to Western claims, and Donetsk rebel leader Denis Pushilin insisted Wednesday there were no Russian troops in the region, even though a local council member claimed the previous day they had moved in. Already, the threat of war has shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos. European Union sanctions against Russia took effect, targeting several companies along with 351 Russian lawmakers who voted for a motion urging Putin to recognize the rebel regions and 27 senior government officials, business executives and top military officers. The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d In Ukraine's east, one Ukrainian soldier was killed and six more wounded after rebel shelling, the Ukrainian military said Wednesday. Separatist officials reported several explosions on their territory overnight and three civilian deaths. Facing a barrage of criticism at the 193-member United Nations General Assembly, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, warned Ukraine that Russia will monitor a cease-fire in the east and emphasized that \u201cno one intends to go softly, softly with any violators.\u201d \u201cA new military adventure\u201d by Kyiv \u201cmight cost the whole of Ukraine very dearly,\u201d he warned ominously. After weeks of rising tensions, Putin's steps this week dramatically raised the stakes. He\u00a0recognized the independence of the separatist regions, a move he said extends even to the large parts of the territories now held by Ukrainian forces, and had parliament grant him authority to use military force outside the country. Putin laid out three conditions that he said could end the standoff, urging Kyiv to renounce its bid to join NATO, to partially demilitarize and to recognize Russia\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine long has rejected such demands.",

        "description": "Nexstar's KXAN talked with University of Texas experts Wednesday to help address some of the questions we've been hearing surrounding that situation growing more tense at Ukraine's borders.",
        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas (KXAN) \u2013 It's a way for University of Texas students to learn about U.S. foreign policy in real time; but as the conflict between the United States and Russia over Ukraine garners more attention, you can benefit too. Dr. Patrick McDonald and Dr. Robert Moser, government professors at UT, have been teaming up with the production crew at the school for a YouTube series they've called \"International News Now.\" The two have been putting together videos on the biggest stories relating to foreign policy for the better part of five years. Now, the focus of those videos has turned to the growing conflict over Ukraine -- and you can watch them for free. Nexstar's KXAN talked with the pair Wednesday to help address some of the questions we've been hearing surrounding the ever-tenser situation at Ukraine's borders. Russia ready to attack Ukraine \u2018now,\u2019 U.S. official says Why is Putin so interested in Ukraine? Russian President\u00a0Vladimir\u00a0Putin has made it a priority to regain territory lost at the end of the Cold War in an attempt to make Russia stronger and the West less dominant. \"What this current crisis over Ukraine is really about is the American-led democratic hegemony that has spread over eastern Europe since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and whether that's going to remain intact, or whether, because Russia objects to it, Russia can use force to rollback that infrastructure,\" Moser said. Ukraine leadership has indicated interest in becoming a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which would jeopardize Putin's goal. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that NATO membership is a distant dream for his country simply because of opposition from Russia and certain members of NATO, not because its public isn't interested. If Ukraine becomes a member of NATO, it would have NATO backing and protection -- it would make Ukraine untouchable by Putin unless he wanted to start a full-blown war with the United States and its allies. \"Putin would rather alter the composition of the government in Kyiv, so they reorient their foreign policy away from the European Union and NATO, and back towards Russia,\" McDonald said. \"That's the long-term political goal.\" Why does the United States government care? McDonald broke that down into two answers: Russia is challenging the foundation of international legal practices and it's challenging the United States to define its role in international affairs, especially when it relates to NATO. McDonald explains that by Putin threatening to invade Ukraine, he's challenging the principles of sovereignty established after the collapse of the Soviet Union, something the Biden administration has taken a strong stand against. \"It's long been the position of the United States that these things should be, if they're going to be renegotiated, they should be done peacefully,\" he said. \"And so we have a situation here where there's a foundational challenge to one of the principal legal components of the international system, whereby Russia is trying to alter political communities that have been set and were negotiated peacefully at the end of the Cold War.\" Gas prices could increase again due to Russia-Ukraine tensions But perhaps even more pressing is not what's to come in the next few weeks with Ukraine, but the role the United States plays in protecting NATO countries moving forward. Putin is testing the waters, so to speak, to find out how much ground he can cover before the United States and its NATO allies are truly willing to wage a war. President Biden has made it abundantly clear over the last couple of weeks that the United States will not send American troops into Ukraine, but that it would engage Russia should they attack a surrounding NATO country. \"I read this as a warm-up in terms of larger changes that could happen in the next 10 or 15 years, whereby [Putin's] trying to figure out and frankly, the Biden administration is too, where's the American public on this? Where's Congress on this?\" McDonald explained. The role the United States plays in this conflict could also inform its role moving forward in the eyes of the international community. \"China -- in particular, as a rising power -- is going to also use its power to increase its influence in its region, and perhaps use force if necessary to incorporate neighboring countries right now, like Taiwan, into its fold,\" Moser said. \"And that's what the United States and the Biden administration is trying to navigate and to, quite obviously, stall or halt to maintain the current status quo.\" Why is Biden talking about this so much? There's an information war happening between Biden and Putin and they're both trying to get their own public, and the world, on board. Putin's talking points aim to make Russia the victim -- to legitimize its looming invasion of Ukraine. The Russian president's stances have made it seem like Russia is defending itself against an expansion of NATO and western allies and that it's fighting back against what it's described as a nationalist, perhaps fascist, regime in Ukraine. \"You'll hear this term false flag operation, which is simply the idea that Russia is actually somehow manipulating or engineering an attack,\" Moser explained. Lawmakers urge Biden to ask Congress before sending military to Ukraine The Biden administration has warned American journalists and the public about a false flag operation, but not provided significant amounts of evidence to show that's actually happening.

One of those politicians keeping a close eye on the oil market is Bay Area Congressman John Garamendi. Garamendi suspects there is already some price gouging and is calling on Congress to schedule a hearing to look into it. Santa Rosa man arrested for alleged sexual assault, at least 12 burglaries \"For sure, they will blame it on all this trouble in Europe, but I don't buy that,\" Garamendi said. \"I would call for a full-scale investigation. I would call the CEOs of the oil industry into a hearing and have them explain exactly why Americans are paying $4.70 to $5-dollars for gasoline.\" \"The price in the Bay Area (was) also up about 13 cents per gallon in the past month. The price increases are going to start picking up steam,\" said Patrick De Haan who is the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com. That is because the annual spring surge in gas prices is just around the corner. That combined with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the forecast is real pain at the pump in the coming weeks and months \"It's essentially 3-different factors that conspire, basically to comingle with each other to push prices up significantly,\" De Haan said. \"Those three factors being the switch to summer gasoline. California has its own special blend. That switch over is starting in Southern California. It will progressively move to Northern California. That type of gasoline tends to be anywhere from 30-cents more per gallon expensive. \"In addition, it comes at a time of year when gasoline demand goes up nationally as we get closer to March and April. Spring break travelers hit the road. That leads to higher demand. At the same time that is happening, refineries are also starting seasonal maintenance, which happens ahead of the summer driving season. Those 3-factors alone usually boost gas prices 25-cents to as much as 75-cents per gallon between March and Memorial Day. Then adding in the situation with Russia. It's a recipe that gas prices in the Bay Area could get deep into the 5-dollar a gallon territory by Memorial Day weekend.\" Congressman Garamendi's office says he is having internal discussions with committees of jurisdiction and requesting they convene a hearing on the topic of price gouging.",

        "content": "(NEXSTAR) \u2013 Russian armed forces are now \"as ready as they can be\" to launch an all-out attack on Ukraine, a senior U.S. official defense official in Washington warned Wednesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information. The official added that 80% of the troops along the Ukrainian border and inside Belarus had moved to \"forward positions\" as of Wednesday. Will the Ukraine conflict go nuclear? Experts answer The Russian forces have \"advanced their readiness to a point where they are literally ready to go \u2013 now,\" the official said.

(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali) The words mirrored those of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told NBC in an interview that \"Russia has positioned its forces at the final point of readiness across Ukraine's borders \u2013 to the north, to the east, to the south \u2013 everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine.\" Fears of an imminent offensive were further heightened late Wednesday when the Kremlin said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression.\u201d FILE - A Ukrainian marine looks on at a fighting position on the line of separation from pro-Russian rebels, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Jan. 7, 2022. A new poll finds little support among Americans for a major U.S. role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. President Joe Biden has acknowledged the growing likelihood of a new war in Eastern Europe will affect Americans even if U.S. troops don\u2019t deploy to Ukraine. Just 26% of Americans say the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Ukraine, after weeks of trying to project calm, imposed a nationwide state of emergency.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) Ukraine\u2019s president is rejecting Moscow\u2019s claim that his country poses a threat to Russia and warns that a looming Russian invasion could cause tens of thousands of deaths. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday. Speaking emotionally in Russia, he said: \u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace. But if we come under attack that threaten our freedom and lives of our people we will fight back.\u201d Zelenskyy says he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday but the Kremlin remained silent.
